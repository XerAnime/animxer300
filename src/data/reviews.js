      review:
        "Lyrical Nanoha ViVid is probably going to be one of the more difficult shows I'll have written a review for lately. It's not the series' fault, as it genuinely does try to stay on-topic with what it presents and progress reasonably. The issue is that the series feels way too ambivalent to commit to anything at times, as well as a few other issues. Unfortunately, Nanoha is no longer the series it was when it started; Nanoha herself actually barely appears outside a few seasons, and even Vivio fails to get any significant amount of spotlight. You can forget Fate and Hayate too, Fate appearingonce or twice all season long, and Hayate only appearing a single time for a very minor scene. So, what's the hook? A girl named Einhart Stratos, who has the memories of a past lifetime and the regrets of the person who used to be, as well as his mysterious relationship with a woman.\n\nThe first major issue with Einhart is that the show rather debatably ignores her backstory and developed lore, for better or for worse. Instead, the focus shifts to how it affects her current life without really delving into her past at all, aside from where the series used it as a plot stepping stone to its current situations. Instead, her development is used to show how she can adjust to her normal life, make friends, and hone her skills. ...Which is actually a great message on its own, even if it does come off as a bit of a deceptive concept. Despite this, her character is remarkably well-developed; it's surprising how well they manage to flesh her out despite this, showing how she copes with her past.\n\nThe tournament arc, supposedly the main arc, takes a backseat and isn't mentioned for quite a while into the series, appearing somewhat underwhelming when it does by following a rather strict formula and not changing things up. I'm not saying it's bad, but it could have used a bit more creativity and thought.",

      review:
        "This was definitely a good time. Got to show off much of the roster of characters, even if many of them didn't get much characterization and the entire idea that they come to this island all together feels a bit farfetched (and if they do, the absence of the Yonkou and several notable Shichibukai feels more than a little strange). Still, it's One Piece and not everything needs to make sense to have a good time. That being said, maybe it's just me being tired of this particular kind of villain, but \"very strong\" and \"has an independent streak\" just isn't enough characterization for me tobe interested. That might not be particularly fair, since the last One Piece movie I saw was Z, and Zephyr was the peak of One Piece movie villains. Still, Bullet is about as interesting as Shiki, which is to say that he has a history in the world that has some meaning, but that's about it. He's just an obstacle in the way of becoming Pirate King.\n\nStill, this movie has a lot going for it. We get some really interesting team-ups, including a big fight involving all the Worst Generation and a rather disparate group of characters from every corner of the world that would never team up under other circumstances. It's nice to see how that latter team-up plays out, and though the former is fun, it feels largely just like a lesser version of their desperate fight against Kizaru in the main series. In all cases, though, the animation is dynamic and colorful. There's a lot to love about these fight scenes and how they amp them up - you can really see what led into the glory that is the Wano Arc. Probably its best moments, though, come from Usopp and Luffy themselves, though I won't spoil those. Overall, it's better than the average One Piece movie, but not as special as I was hoping to see.",

      review:
        "God, I adore this movie. It feels like a story to be passed on for generations. The animation is just fantastic. Such skill and love went into every frame. The writhing of demons was done in such a way that I felt squeamish just looking at them. Ashitaka is a powerful, but flat character. He doesn't change, though I felt he didn't need to. He was mature, brave, and strong in the face of such adversity. He is someone to aspire to be, despite his obvious naïveté. The Princess is lovely, a human among wolves who chooses to remain a wolf. I've never been muchof an environmentalist, but this film sure does make me want to start a garden. It felt odd having no set villains, or at least, the antagonists continuing to live. Lady Eboshi was such a good character, very conflicting were and are my feelings for her. On one hand, she wants to behead the forest spirit to save Irontown, but on the other hand, she cares for the needy and wants the best for the people in her town. The characters, animation, and score all coalesce into this beautiful work that I never had the desire to look away from, only to bask in its love and wonder.",

        "Sword Art Online Abridged is probably the best anime of all time. Characters, humour, plot, inside jokes, animation, voice acting, ALL 10/10 Available to watch on youtube for free. You have no excuse not to watch it. Not only that but the show has only improved over the years. Episode 17 is one of the best anime episodes ever and it came from a parody? How is this possible? I don't know. Nothing makes sense any more. The fact they spend 6 months on each episode probably helps. Each episode is gold. No filler,no boring parts, no plot holes or stupid 2D characters,  just laughing crying and adventure.\n\nSword Art Online the original is ok.  Really liked the first 14 episodes. It made me care enough about the characters enough to overlook plot and writing issues, and also drag myself through the rest of the series.  \n\nIf you hated SAO You will love SAO  Abridged\nIf you loved SAO You will love SAO  Abridged\nIf you never watched SAO You will love SAO  Abridged (and don't bother watching SAO, Abridged is all you need)\n\nSo to recap I gave SAO 8/10 for making the first 14 episodes and the source animation for  SAO  Abridged",

        "Aug 1, 2023 Zombieland Saga Revenge (Anime) edit Recommended (this is a review of both Zombieland saga and revenge as I watched both very close to each other) I came to Zombieland Saga because I heard it had some trans rep in Lily (number 6) and as a trans woman I want more of that in my shows and media that I am consuming. What I got was meh trans rep and a new show to add to the list of my favorite anime. This is first and foremost an idol show, think K-on, every single plot point and character arc is related to the fact they are idols.because you know thats what the show is about I am going to shift this review to be about Lily and the trans rep in her because that is a very specific part of the show I came to it for and that I am sure other people like me will as well.\nLily is a kind of representation where by her words and by the story she is trans but it doesn't really effect her character in any meaningful way. because her character is so young we never see her deal with her dysphoria in a major way (the one time it is addressed its sort of treated as a joke, but not really I cant really tell the tone of the scene). And outside of her one episode in season one the fact she is trans is never brought up again. Don't take this wrong Lily is awesome, her episode in revenge is one of my favorite episodes in the show. It really lets her shine, unfortunately she gets noticeably less lines then a lot of the other cast, she is a character I desperately want more from but they way they have written her so far is disappointing in that I font think there is much else to get from her transness. I hope the movie and any possible future seasons proves me wrong with this (I have not read any manga or other material that this might be based on so i font know if this is the end or not, from the show it doesn't feel like it wants to end yet but who knows.)",

      review:
        "(this is a review of both Zombieland saga and revenge as I watched both very close to each other) I came to Zombieland Saga because I heard it had some trans rep in Lily (number 6) and as a trans woman I want more of that in my shows and media that I am consuming. What I got was meh trans rep and a new show to add to the list of my favorite anime. This is first and foremost an idol show, think K-on, every single plot point and character arc is related to the fact they are idols. because you know thats what theshow is about I am going to shift this review to be about Lily and the trans rep in her because that is a very specific part of the show I came to it for and that I am sure other people like me will as well. \nLily is a kind of representation where by her words and by the story she is trans but it doesn't really effect her character in any meaningful way. because her character is so young we never see her deal with her dysphoria in a major way (the one time it is addressed its sort of treated as a joke, but not really I cant really tell the tone of the scene). And outside of her one episode in season one the fact she is trans is never brought up again. Don't take this wrong Lily is awesome, her episode in revenge is one of my favorite episodes in the show. It really lets her shine, unfortunately she gets noticeably less lines then a lot of the other cast, she is a character I desperately want more from but they way they have written her so far is disappointing in that I font think there is much else to get from her transness. I hope the movie and any possible future seasons proves me wrong with this (I have not read any manga or other material that this might be based on so i font know if this is the end or not, from the show it doesn't feel like it wants to end yet but who knows.)",

      review:
        "Much like Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica this show doesn't pull any punches. You haven't seen Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica? ok well add that to your list too. Majo no Tabitabi is lighter and more upbeat in general but still gets very dark in parts. You may expect a slice of life with generic characters but instead get something far more nuanced then we expect from typical anime these days. Sometimes bad things happen. Sometimes you can help, and sometimes you can't. Sometimes you make things worse. Sometimes you can say \"That problem is not my problem\" (a logical stance neverbefore taken by anime protagonists) \n\nI suppose I was delighted by the show's willingness to break most rules of anime and have real characters make real choices.  Sane choices by real world standards.  Also when characters help others there is no guarantee they will make the situation better, things could go poorly, you just don't know.  This keeps you guessing about choices, about outcomes, about everything.\n\nDelightful surprising anime.  Would recommend.",

      review:
        "KnY S3 is good. It is not on par with S2. If S2 is 8.8/10, then S3 is the 8.3/10 that it has on here. It doesn't meet the marks that S2 does, but still, S3 was enjoyable. It's content that you turn off your brain and binge with ease. This series garners a lot of criticism, and I'm one who didn't really like S1. The animation throughout the series is great, but the one problem has always been its lacking storyline. It's very shallow, and we lack information, in exchange for fights and animation. This isfine, I don't think the storyline is anywhere near the trash that comes out of Hollywood, so KnY will pretty much always be a series I can rely on to deliver. \n\nAnimation 10/10\n-  It's Ufotable.\nSound 10/10\n-  Great OP ED, good BGM and impactful soundtrack at the end.\nStory 5/10\n-  It's about getting his sword, and includes fights, other than that, the story just lacks expansion of our knowledge of this world.\nCharacters 9/10\n-  Mitsuri was a nice character to delve into, I really wanted to know more of her story, and see more of her on the battlefield.  Genya and Muichirou were ok.  I was kind of glad we didn't have to hear much obnoxious crying from Zenitsu.\nEnjoyment 8/10\n-  Like I said, it was good, not great, but was easy to binge.  Simple brain food for someone looking to just enjoy the simple stuff this series offers.\n\nI recommend KnY to everyone, especially those who have no enemies.",

I have seriously never had any piece of media anger and frustrate me so much between all the boredom (which makes the majority of the run-time). Fuck you, elfen lied, my all time least favourite piece of media and I hate everything you stand for. Watch for episode 1 if you enjoy scenes of mook massacre, but there is absolutely no reason to watch the rest of it. The mystery is garbage, the main character is in an incestuous relationship with his cousin, and the story revolves around amnesia plots.",

        "I found this by browsing the Mahou Shoujo genre for new things I've missed, this was there and I remembered seeing it free on YouTube from the artist who wrote it. Thought it'd be a good opportunity to review it since no one else has at this point in time. This is an extremely pretty music video using the theme song of Sailor Moon Cosmos which I have yet to see. The character designs are stunning and I wish I could learn more about them, the colors and art style feel so good and I actually kind of wish we got an actual anime inthis style and with these characters. Overall the plot seems nice and mysterious although it's just a music video so most story elements are up to interpretation, but I could see the feelings behind the characters' faces and actions. It feels like a genuine opening to an anime, I love it! If you like Sailor Moon, you'll probably like this. How it's not anything more then a music video so if you're searching for anything more you may be disappointed.",

        "When I first watched this movie, it was very confusing to me. I am familiar with movies like this such as Inception, so I knew what I was getting into. It took me three times to watch the movie to fully understand what was happening. Dreams bleeding into reality. If you watch it one time you probably will not understand what's happening. But if you truly do what to understand this movie I recommend watching it at least two times. Other than the story, the animation is beautiful with bright colors that have a dark undertone. The Soundtrack blends perfectly with the visuals. All togetherthis movie felt like a dream.",

      review:
        "Gravitation is a romantic comedy about an up and coming musician and his whirlwind relationship with an aloof, emotionally stunted author. It continues the proud tradition of romance protagonists fighting against all odds to keep someone important to them, while being surrounded by a cast of characters who would all be better, for them. The early episodes were a bit of a chore to get through. In true paperback romance fashion, the stock and trade of Gravitation, on a scene-by-scene basis, is emotional immediacy. Everything that happens to Shuichi and Yuki is the height of drama, the stakes are as high as they're ever going tobe, and every episode feels like the season finale or even the series finale. It can be a bit much to take in. I'm still trying to get acclimated to the characters and the world, and I'm being forced to deal with emotional tones that would come at the end of a more competently paced series.\n\nIn truth, you're not supposed to watch the show with a critical eye, like I decided to do. Rather, you're supposed to immerse yourself in the feels, accept the vibes as they're presented to you. Once I reminded myself to do that, it got a fair sight more tolerable. I even wound up enjoying my experience, by the end. A few of the sight gags are actually pretty funny, and once the writers decided to get past Yuki's initial phase of \"playing dumb manipulative games with the heart of some dude who literally doesn't deserve it,\" I found his struggles to engage emotionally with Shuichi to be... coherent? Interesting? I was engaged with it.\n\nThere are a few elements of the plot I don't particularly like. Without going into spoilers, certain elements get thrown around that the writers, I feel, don't handle with the appropriate level of respect. Rather heavy plot beats get dropped into the story, seemingly for no other reason than to create drama, and are discarded as irrelevant as soon as they've been allowed to appear on screen and make the JoJo \"menacing\" vignette at the protagonists. But, as I said, this sort of high intensity emotional storytelling is de riguer for romances, and by letting go and stewing in the vibes, the intended experience was still more positive than negative.\n\nOverall, I'd probably put Gravitation in between a 6 and a 7. It is an okay show. If you're a fan of romance stories, this is definitely an appealing one to watch.",

        "when i first read the reviews i was surprised that there weren't many bad ratings. this made me wonder about this anime. seeing a new generation school love anime get good ratings, made me hopeful and i started it. but seriously there is nothing to see here. story 2/10: while watching this anime i always felt uncomfortable about something. this was cheap like ordinary, boring, and stereotype anime so i have nothing to say. a lame male mc and a girl mc whose only personality trait is her physical appearance. characters 1/10: what i dislike the most about kyoutarou is he makes himself look like aloser. his obsession with k*lling is truly adolescent. like the thoughts of someone who has never talked to a girl before. but the fact that he has a protective personality makes the anime watch a little bit.\nanna is the character that makes up the general audience of this anime. she is existed for satisfaction of men.\n\nanimation 5/10:\nthe only good thing",

      review:
        'This anime is nothing more than vampire FAN FICTION and just like most stereotypical fan fiction, it is VERY BAD. I do NOT recommend watching this. 3/10 ----------------- PROS ----------------- • The premise of this story is somewhat unique. Sure, there are several other vampire anime, but it\'s not a very common genre compared to superheroes, romance, or slice of life. • The action scenes are also pretty decent. It\'s usually fun and pretty creative, and they come regularly in almost every episode. • The world is somewhat interesting. Steampunk Paris with Vampires and an Alternate History Storyline. The writing uses a lot of fancy wordswhich is... fine.\n\n• A lot SEEMS to happen very quickly and the show jumps from beat to beat with fast pacing.\n\n----------------- CONS -----------------\n• I say "seems" because NOTHING actually happens across this anime.  The characters will say that things are happening and there might be some action occurring on screen, but nothing relevant or significant to the plot is taking place. \n\n• The world is not compelling enough to keep us interested while the characters literally do NOTHING but talk (even during action scenes). And our main character KEEPS INTRODUCING HIMSELF OVER AND OVER.\n\n• And of course he does! Because this series CONSTANTLY introduces brand new characters each episode (sometimes multiple) who have absolutely nothing to contribute to the story or make the conflict more interesting. Our protagonists just dilly-dally from location to location, meeting new people, "saving the day" and then go home and get their blood sucked or whatever.\n\n• Characters have no clear motivation. The story has no clear destination. There is nothing at stake. "I want to save all the vampires." Okay, cool, but why should I care about that quest?\n\n• I hate the villain\'s voice, it\'s so goddamn annoying.\n\n----------------- What I Wish This Anime Was -----------------\n• One aspect that I personally wanted more from was the romance, surprisingly enough. I know my opening line criticizes Vanitas no Karte for being "fan fiction" but honestly, if the creator(s) want to go down that route, then they should go ALL IN rather than trying to do everything (drama, action, mystery, romance, etc.)\n\n• The interactions between Vantias and Jeanne were actually compelling, albeit barely fleshed out. Not to mention, Noé\'s unspoken jealousy and homoerotic longing for Vantias from the sidelines. Between the four or five recurring characters, there was plenty of room for a full-blown soap opera to take place, while still having some of the action and mystery included.\n\n\nOverall, this anime is simply not worth watching. I will check out season 2 because of its rating on MAL, but I\'m not looking forward to it.',

        '---Original language: Potuguese--- ---Additional language: English--- English: When I watched this anime I thought it would be totally generic, with a "hero" and "demon king", but it honestly caught my attention for running away from the "standard" good or egocentric king, the proper king not knowing of its existence makes things more curious The anime features a lot of "Time-skip" that pleases me even, because it does not give the feeling of bad unfolding of the story I feel like a sequel with more to explore the past is a good one But besides that there is not much to stand out, besides the protagonist being good, my notefor the anime is: 7/10\n\nPT-BR: Quando assisti esse anime pensei que seria totalmente genrico, com um "heroi" e "rei demonio", mas sinceramente me chamou atenção por fugir do "padrão" rei bonzinho ou egocêntrico, o propio rei nao saber de sua existencia torna as coisas mais curiosas\nO anime apresenta bastante "Time-skip" que me agrada até, pois assim não passa a sensação de má desenrolar da historia\nsinto que uma continuação com mais a se explorar o passado seja uma boa\nMas alem disso não há muito a se destacar, alem do protagonista ser bom, minha nota para o anime é : 7/10',

        'At first, I didn\'t like it so much. The animation feels really cheap, and Aresuke sometimes sounds out of tune or off-beat. The scenes also look to vibrant and busy for me. And then... Rokutan started singing... all in "mu"s and "meh"s. And suddenly I was thoroughly enjoying my experience. There\'s just something about it that makes me smile, even giggle. I\'m sure eight-year-old me would have loved this just for Rokutan. Rokutan single-handedly saved the entire experience for me. While I rate it as fine overall, I still recommend it solely for the enjoyment you will find when you hear Rokutan.',

      review:
        "\"We're all living together with pain.\" -Inoue Takehiko, Slam Dunk creator From longtime fans to complete newcomers alike, The First Slam Dunk is a resounding slam dunk, its reverberations lasting for days, maybe months and even years to come. On one hand, it is the long-dreamed-of anime adaptation of the legendary final match of the manga, a series that singlehandedly popularized basketball in Japan and is beloved by people all across the world. On the other hand, it is an anime-original deep dive into the past of Miyagi Ryota, Shohoku's short, speedy point guard who, compared to the rest of Shohoku's members, did not receive asmuch development and backstory in the original series, making it all the more welcome.\n\nThe focus on Miyagi may have surprised and even upset those who are longtime fans (it sure surprised me when I first heard about it), even more so because the entire movie is mostly from his perspective, not from Sakuragi's (unarguably the heart and soul of Slam Dunk) like in the manga. That being said, much like the deft dribbling of our speedstar protagonist, The First Slam Dunk skillfully handles and weaves together the Shohoku-Sannoh match with the numerous threads of Miyagi's past, and much of this success can be attributed to the director, none other than Inoue Takehiko, the creator of Slam Dunk himself.\n\nCan you even imagine that this is the man's directorial debut, his first time creating an anime, and it's of this caliber? (Caution: following part may be a bit rambly)\n\nFirst let's talk about the cg. Oh, the dreaded cg. \n\nBut. \nIt. \nActually. \nLooks.\nPhenomenal.\n\nAside from a few hiccups here and there, the quality of the visuals are extremely high (I personally dislike cg in anime but this has blown my expectations out of the water and sent it soaring into the sky). Pardon my limited skills of expression, but the basketball game actually looks and feels like a basketball game. This was achieved by a combination of motion capture of actual players and subsequent editing and fine-tuning, and the result is absolutely fantastic. There is so much detail put into animating every person on the court (as well as those off the court) and their every move; the dribbling, the passing, the shooting, the running, the jumping, the cheering, literally everything. \n\n\"First, I had the desire to depict basketball like it was basketball. The 10 people on the court each doing their own thing at a tremendous speed. Furthermore, the differing movements of those on the bench. I came to the conclusion that it was nearly impossible to hand-draw all of them, and believed that CG was necessary. On top of that, I absolutely wanted to portray them as natural human beings, and that sentiment was like my starting point and end goal.\"\n\nInoue's focus on the \"natural\" also manifests itself in another way: the decision to make Miyagi the protagonist instead of Sakuragi.\n\n\"When I was working on the Slam Dunk manga, I was in my twenties. More precisely, the 6-year period from age 23 to age 29. As a mangaka, it's a phase where you keep getting better as you keep on drawing. You have the stamina, the mentality to keep pushing yourself to unreasonable extents, your sense of values are like an upward trajectory. Similarly, the protagonist has a large body, and is hiding incredible abilities. He was a protagonist with unlimited possibilities. I think that story was extremely popular back in those days. It was for that reason that I ended the manga there, to preserve that phase, that time of my life. 26 years later, my point of view, the sense of values inside me has changed greatly... and has increased. Like pain, or that there are a lot of times where things don't go well, stuff that everyone goes through and I've also been through. Carrying the pain, overcoming the pain, I wanted to show a perspective like that. And aren't we all like that? Not all of us are people with unlimited potential and possibilities. We're all living together with pain. I believed the current me could write from that perspective. I want to shine a spotlight on it, focus on it. If I were to be involved I'd want to do it from that kind of perspective, was what was on my mind.\"\n\nWe're all living together with pain. \n\nThe pain of suddenly losing family members, when they still had so much to live for.\nThe pain of those who live on, constantly reminded of those who have passed away.\nThe pain of struggling to improve, comparing yourself to others and losing confidence and willpower as you realize the extent of your abilities.\nThe pain of injuries, both physical and mental, and trying to overcome them the best you can.\nThe pain of living your own way, where you get beaten down for what you believe is right, and sometimes there's nothing you can do about it.\n\nPain, in its various meanings, has certainly been a theme in the original manga, but Miyagi's past is jam-packed with such themes. It is a very humane side of Slam Dunk, one that is about human weakness and perseverance over the many obstacles that life presents. It is the culmination of decades of Inoue's changing values and perspectives, as well as a lasting testament to his growth, both as a creator and as a person.\n\n※　※　※\n\n\"Also, there was a certain episode that led me to the name 'The First Slam Dunk.' A person who was recommending an interesting manga to a friend who hasn't read it said, 'You're just starting it now, I'm so jealous' and I was like, 'Oh I see.' To the people who've read Slam Dunk and already know what happens, I wanted them to feel 'Wow, there's a \"Slam Dunk\" like this?\", as if they were reading it for the first time. I wanted people to experience the act of crossing paths with 'Slam Dunk,' there is also that kind of meaning to it.\"\n\n\"Wow, there's a 'Slam Dunk' like this?' was exactly what I was thinking as I was watching it on the big screen and as I reminisced about it afterwards. Miyagi's past of course takes up a large part of that, but let's not forget about the Shohoku-Sannoh match. Longtime fans, you already know what's up. Newcomers, you're in for the treat of your lives as you experience the never-letting-up tsunami of the greatest moments from any sports series, or heck, any series at all. \n\nI've said this once already, but I'll say it again. It. Looks. Phenomenal. The on-point visuals combined with the hypeness and legendary moments of the game (there are a lot of those) is honestly something you need to experience once in your life. Even if you know nothing about the series, or have no interest in basketball, I highly urge you to give it a try (Inoue himself has said Slam Dunk is not a basketball story, it could've been any other sport while portraying the same themes). You can easily pick up on the general personalities and motivations of the main characters, and still appreciate what's going on even without any prior knowledge because it's just that nice with it.\n\nSpeaking as a longtime fan who's read the manga countless times, I would even say that there are a few aspects where the anime does a better job than the manga on how it portrays the game (heresy, I know). And most of that lies in the flow. The movie cuts a lot of internal dialogue and thought processes present in the manga, making for a highly visually-immersive experience where you're simply drawn into the play and can infer certain things based off what's being shown alone. It's not like those elements were bad in the manga either, as they are quite relevant to the moments occurring at hand and are used sparingly, but I love the decision to prioritize the dynamic, quick-paced nature of basketball games, where obviously you won't be able to stop time and monologue for 2 minutes. Something much more awkward in anime than in manga, that's for sure.\n\nAnother difference between the manga and anime mediums is of course, the existence of sound. Although Inoue did not work on the audio himself (being far easier to transfer manga -&gt; anime skillset than manga -&gt; audio skillset when sound is a nonfactor in manga), the audio, just like the visuals, are on point. The soundtrack is hype, the sound effects like the dribbling and swishing of the ball are peak ASMR, and the decision to partially mute or completely mute sound for certain scenes is exquisite and really enhances the experience. I would say my only complaint is the voice acting, but that's mostly because I'm used to the 1990s anime cast (a project where Inoue did not have much involvement, compared to his insane levels of involvement with the movie). Inoue was also going for a more natural feel with the voice acting cast, and the more subdued feel was refreshing in its own way. In any case I'll probably get used to them as well after I watch the movie like 10 times.\n\nAlthough earlier I did praise the decision to cut stuff from the manga to maintain the overall flow, this also led to some of the best scenes of the manga not being adapted. Which is fair enough because for a lot of them, you would need to have knowledge of prior events in the series, and there's no real good way to fit them in without drastically increasing the runtime and alienating complete newcomers. But as a longtime fan, oh how I wished to see those moments being adapted. I doubt this will ever happen but I would die for another movie focusing solely on the Shohoku-Sannoh match. And for those who've watched the movie without any knowledge of the series, I highly recommend reading the manga for more Slam Dunk fun.\n\nAnd finally, some closing remarks from Inoue-sensei: \n\n\"As I drew new things I wanted to make people happy, even if just a little. And each time, I've seen the delighted faces of those who enjoyed my work. If I could make people happy -- such a sentiment was certainly in me when I agreed to make 'The First Slam Dunk.'\"\n\n\nSlam Dunk/10\n\n\n*Quotes come from various interviews and are my very rough translations\n*I highly recommend watching 【静止画MAD】THE RED【SLAMDUNK】 for 4 minutes of pure Slam Dunk greatness\n*Hands are an important motif\n*There is an after-credits scene\n*I love Slam Dunk",

      review:
        'Tate no Yuusha Season 2, unfortunately, fails to live up to the expectations set by its predecessor, delivering a lackluster and disappointing experience for fans of the series. One of the most glaring issues that immediately stands out is the animation and character design. The lack of facial expressions makes it challenging to connect with the characters emotionally, hindering any attempts to understand their feelings or motivations. Whether it\'s anger, joy, or sadness, every scream feels indistinguishable, further dampening the impact of critical scenes. The show also suffers from inconsistent character development and shallow storytelling. Characters flip-flop between sides too quickly, making it difficult to believein the relationships and alliances that form. There seems to be a lack of planning and hidden agendas, reducing the complexity and depth of the plot. Furthermore, the ease with which characters are manipulated and convinced takes away the tension and excitement that should be present in a fantasy series like this.\n\nThe lack of difficulty in defeating bosses and beasts removes any sense of challenge or accomplishment for the protagonists. Battles that should have been epic and thrilling end up feeling mundane and underwhelming. As a result, the story becomes stale and uninteresting, with very few engaging action sequences to keep you invested.\n\nThe addition of a harem subplot feels forced and unconvincing, failing to add any meaningful value to the overall narrative. It\'s more of a distraction than a contributing factor, detracting from the main storyline. Moreover, the characters in the show seem to be either over-informed or entirely ignorant, leaving no room for gradual discovery or development.\n\nThe presence of unnecessary cute creatures with weird sounds only serves gratuitous fanservice. Their roles could have been replaced with a more thought-out system, like the gemstone concept mentioned (the closer you are to your destination the shinier the stone). This would have enhanced the story\'s depth and relevance instead of providing empty and distracting fluff.\n\nThe perspectives of Glass, Lark, and the 3rd partner lack proper justification and explanation, making it challenging for viewers to understand their motivations and actions. The rapid shift from enemies to allies feels poorly executed and does not resonate with you, leaving a feeling of dissatisfaction.\n\nThe art style quality is further hindered by poorly designed head shapes for some characters, making it visually unappealing and distracting from the overall experience. It\'s disappointing to see such attention to detail lacking in an animated series.\n\nThe main villain, "Kyo," suffers from lackluster characterization, failing to possess any qualities that make a formidable adversary. He lacks strength, motivation, planning, and charisma, making him forgettable and unremarkable as a villain. A good antagonist should inspire awe and fear, but "Kyo" falls flat.\n\nFurthermore, the plot, scenario, and character writing all feel poorly executed, with little to no cleverness in the storytelling. The season feels like a filler, lacking the depth and excitement that I anticipated.\n\nThe concept of "power of friendship" has been overused in anime, and in this case, it feels forced and clichéd. It detracts from the seriousness of the plot and undermines the potential for a more intricate and engaging narrative.\n\nAdditionally, the absence of memorable music and special moments is another missed opportunity for the show to leave a lasting impression on its audience. A strong soundtrack and impactful scenes can elevate an anime to greatness, but Tate no Yuusha Season 2 fails to deliver in this aspect.\n\nIn conclusion, Tate no Yuusha Season 2 struggles with a myriad of issues, including lackluster animation, shallow character development, an uninspired plot, and unimpressive writing. The lack of effort in various aspects of the show results in a subpar experience that fails to captivate or leave a lasting impression. As a result, it may leave you disappointed and longing for the excellence that the first season promised.\n\nRatings:\n\nPlot: 5/10\nWhile the plot does have some shortcomings, it still manages to deliver a decent narrative with a mix of action and adventure. It may not be as strong as the first season, but it provides some engaging moments.\n\nArt Style: 6/10\nThe art style remains generally appealing and consistent throughout the season. While there are some issues with character head shapes, it doesn\'t significantly impact the overall visual experience.\n\nAnimation: 6/10\nAlthough the lack of facial expressions is a drawback, the animation is generally smooth and well done in other aspects, particularly during action sequences.\n\nMain Characters: 5/10\nWhile the main characters are serviceable, they lack the depth and development needed to truly stand out. They might not be as memorable or compelling as one would hope for in a fantasy anime.\n\nSide Characters: 3/10\nThe side characters are criticized for their quick shifts in allegiance and easy manipulation, reducing their impact on the story and making their presence less meaningful.\n\nVillains: 2/10\nThe main villain, "Kyo," receives strong criticism for lacking compelling traits or motivations, making him forgettable and unimpressive as an antagonist.\n\nMusic: 5/10\nWhile the soundtrack provides some background atmosphere, it fails to leave a lasting impression. The lack of standout tracks and memorable musical moments takes away from the overall impact of the series.\n\nFight Scenes: 4/10\nThe fights are noted to lack difficulty and challenge, resulting in underwhelming and unexciting battle sequences.\n\nEnjoyment: 4/10\nGiven the numerous issues pointed out in the review, the overall enjoyment of Tate no Yuusha Season 2 is relatively low. It fails to capture the excitement and engagement that viewers would expect from a fantasy anime.\n\nOverall: (4.5/10): Bad - Average',

      review:
        "Violet evergarden was majestic. everything in it, the art, the animation, the writing and the emotions were beautiful. while watching it i have felt emotions that i haven't felt in a long time. The anime starts with violet, emotionless, robotic, calling herself a weapon for major Gilbert. as the war ended, she had no purpose. because of that she demanded to be \"thrown away\". after hearing that prisedent Hodgins decided to take her to his company so she can work. she wasn't suitable at anything she did. but then she learns about the auto memory doll service. auto memory dolls are girls who write letters for peoplewho can't write, crafting the customer's emotions into a proper beautiful letter. Violet is watching the doll at work when she hears the phrase \"I love you\", a phrase that she heard before from major Gilbert but does not know the meaning of, so she starts to work as an auto memory doll in pursuit of learning the meaning of \"I love you\".\n\nthe emotions in Violet Evergarden are portrayed beautifully. as viewers we go with Violet through everything in her journy to learn emotions, because of that every smile, tear, frown is so much more heavier to me, when Violet cries, her tears are much more impactful because we know she couldn't cry before, we see how with every customer and letter she writes, she makes progress, she 'feel' things for the first time, all the people Violet meet through her job have beautiful stories of their own as we see how Violet go through them, all the characters are interesting with many complex emotions that Violet tries to figure out. these individual stories are my favorite part of the anime, many of them made me tear up. these stories are so perfect.\n\nwhen Violet learns how to empathize, she starts to regret, she is burning from her past, her regret is heartbreaking and feels too real, i don't wanna spoil it, i hated seeing her like that.\n\nThe art in Violet Evergarden is a master piece, the art completes every emotional/gorgeous scene, every scene in Violate Evergarden feels like a breath of fresh air, the colors are cozy and every character is so pretty. Violet clothes are very pretty too and well designed, and also the calming ambient... man everything is beautiful. if i wanted to describe the whole anime in a word it would be \"beautiful\"\n\nthe fact that Violet Evergarden made me feel the most amount of emotions out of all things i have watched in my life is enough for me. this show is a master piece.\n\nfavorite episode: ep10\n\n5/5",

        "As an no-life isekai enjoyer, if you: - like isekai, - enjoys isekai - and. have time to watch it. Then watch it. MIXED FEELINGS because, I don't think it would be worth for some especially when 'I' feel like the story's pacing, or at least in this adaptation isn't quite right or enjoyable. I kind of hate it when the information are rushed in the last few episodes where you are forced to process these details(maybe I'm stupid), I'll end up with 'what just happened?'. Especially at the ending where cases like, \"the problem is solved, the end\", \"I'll give you a minute or twofor the after scenes, the end\". \n\nMy main problem about this anime is about the lack of explanation on the MC, I feel like there's little detail on his background that I had to search it somewhere in the internet to further understand. \n\nAND to clarify, I didn't put all of the anime I know here on MAL, I wouldn't want someone to see this review of mine and think that, \"oh this dude only knows new animes\".\n\nAnyways, this is my opinion, my review, maybe by watching it you'd see the better side of the anime. Sorry for bad Engrish, PEACE!",

      review:
        "THIS, this is where Attack on Titan reached masterpiece for me. The show finally crossed the line of amazing thrill and shocking moments to \"investing\". In an arc filled with big battle scenes, the best episodes were deeply psychological. I enjoy the battle strategies of this arc, so much big brain energy on all sides. I love the theme of owning up to one decision with no regrets that the show explored, each choice revealed each character's essence. How in a war, you will end up losing something, but choosing what to lose is also a big part of survival. It really elevate the conflictin each scene.\nThe arc also finally provide us the satisfaction of learning the \"truth\" and the consequences of obtaining it. Sometimes that might not you free, and you can feel the weight of that on the characters. You know the world change from this point forward, and it just bring so much excitement and dread.\n\nTop 3 characters this season: Eren (The hell this boy has been through. Eren's forever change by the truth, with his whole believe system being stripped down.), Hanji (She's been one of my favorite characters on the show as an advocate for progress, but she also hold the scout together emotionally here.), Floch (Probably controversial yet I think he adds so much depth to AOT. We've only seen the story from our main cast POV and have our bias, but as an outsider, he was the one affected by their choices without being able to choose.)",

        "I thought the anime was very fun and polished. I get that the plot was a little all over the place, but if they had actually made a show rather than this tiny pilot, I think it could've been something iconic. The writing was well put together, the animation wasn't horrible, and the music was very charming. The only flaw seemed to be the story, but there's only so much you can shove into a pilot. I thought the art style was good, compared to most 80s anime. The only character that really annoyed me was Shizuka, but that mostly stemmed from the fact Idon't really like high pitched anime characters all too much.",

        "Trigun Stampede accomplishes extremely well what Netflix’s Cannon Busters tried (and failed) to do. Both are violent, gritty, and set in a post-apocalyptic, wild-west-meets-cyberpunk world, but Trigun succeeds by keeping the focus on the mystery of its title character: Vash the Stampede. The (fully CGI) animation is stunning, and there is something so captivating about this dismal, decaying world. It’s a slow burn story but with plenty of action, heart, and imagination, all culminating in a visually astonishing finale. If you come into this wearing nostalgia glasses you're going to be disappointed as it watches nothing like its predecessor. Instead, treat it like you're tryinggiant sand worm meat for the first time... you may just be delighted.",

        "This was honestly beyond my expectations! Starting off with it being a donghua adaptation, the animation style and the cgi was fairly impressive! What caught me most is still how the story proceeded with lots of twists while giving us character development as much as possible. I loved how the story proceeded with the starting episode. It basically was the best way to grab people's attention with the escape room theme. As much as once could piece the story together, the ending still caught me hanging and wanting for more. There were definitely a couple of loose ends throughout but honestly it feels like theywere kept in purpose to enthrall the user experience and keep them wanting for more. I do feel a couple of scenes were exaggerated however it didn't fail its purpose and I liked that it made me think.\n\nIt was a great watch altogether! Binge-worthy!",

        "This anime is basically a child's imagination. What I mean by that is you know how children try building themselves up in their own heads? Like, \" I'm the strongest, most powerful person in the world and I'm also super cool and everybody likes me and tells me how cool I am, and I got really pretty girls and also I'm super rich and awesome and nothing bad can ever happen to me because I'm the best.\" the only reason why it's not a one to me, is because the animation is pretty beautiful. the story is not unique by any stretch and if youlike characters that are overpowered, there is a ton of other options that you will actually like instead of hate watching like I did this show. Overlord, one punch man, that time I got reincarnated as a slime, The eminence in shadow, MOB pscho100 etc. Any of these shows and many others like them are way better than this hot steaming pile of garbage.",

        "When it aired, I was only 10 years old, but I had already read the manga series and owned all the volumes. I didn't have any doubts about the transition from manga to anime; I was excited to see it come to life. Decades later, rewatching it in its entirety, the ending theme brought back memories, and I felt a wave of nostalgia. I used to hold a tape recorder close to the TV speaker to record and listen to it repeatedly. This anime, which predates Initial D by over 10 years, was the only manga at the time that portrayed the allure of cars. Theidea of using \"Nitro\" as fuel was mind-blowing. The animation and script might not be as refined as in modern anime, but for us kids in 1984, it was more than enough, and we eagerly looked forward to watching it every week. It became a standard Japanese anime for me. In that sense, it deserves a solid 5 out of 10 as a baseline score.\n\nHowever, the anime doesn't delve deeply into cars or provide detailed explanations of driving techniques like Initial D does. But if you're interested in experiencing the vibrant atmosphere of 1980s Japan, I recommend giving it a go.",

        ">Story There's not much story to write about - just the protagonist's delusions about random people being in love with her. Other than this, we don't learn anything about any characters. It's not a story-driven anime in the first place. >Art Very simplistic, but clean. The exception are delusion scenes where art gets slightly more detailed. >Sound Other than characters speaking, and an 10 second \"ending\" there's nothing to describe. Both fulfill their purpose well enough. >CharacterComplete zero. Everyone is a paper cutout to whom a seiyuu lends their voice. \n\n&gt;Enjoyment\nThe premise is somewhat enjoyable, sadly the execution is lacking in all aspects. For that reason, this anime is not really worth watching.",

      review:
        "This anime is probably one of my favorite slice of life animes. The premise of the entire show was just so adorable, wholesome, and just beautiful. Plot: The plot is very simple, it’s about Nishimura, a young girl who is often bullied by her classmates because of her eyes that resemble the Grim Reaper. But her life is turned around when she meets Takada, a young boy who is very energetic and oblivious to things around him. Because of his energetic nature, he befriended Nishimura despite whatever his classmates tell about her. This plot is very adorable and wholesome and is actually progressive, seeing throughout that Nishimuraimproves in her social skills, befriending Takada’s sister, Umi, Kasahara, and Hino as such. \n\nCharacters: Although the art seems very simplistic, it also fits the anime’s lighthearted nature. The character designs are decent, but what I like the most are their personalities (excluding Kitagawa’s). Nishimura from a very introverted person to a now much happier girl thanks to Takada’s sunny personality that helps her get out of her shell. I love their dynamic because you can really see that Takada is very outspoken in how he thinks of Nishimura, completely ignoring his classmates’ opinions of Nishimura. \n\nTheir crushes on one another is also very endearing, but the scene that really took the cake was the scene he found out about Nishimura’s deceased mother. I love how considerate he was of her feelings, feeling extremely bad for calling her the Grim Reaper (albeit in a loving manner) since it seemed “related” to the fact that Nishimura’s died because of her through difficult childbirth (or maybe some other reason, since it was unsaid). I loved how he cried and apologized and they just held hands on the way home, taking longer routes to stay together longer to comfort Takada. That episode really struck me.\n\nAnother character that I love is Nishimura’s father who’s very supportive and loving towards Nishimura, marinating eggs for her so that she could strike conversations with friends easily, accompanying her in buying a swimsuit, and also crying with joy when she sent him a photo of her and her friends eating lunch together. I love how his love is displayed very well even if those scenes were very brief. \n\nI also love Kasahara’s character development, starting out as one of the major bullies to now being Nishimura’s good friend. Initially, I was very annoyed with how she would keep bullying Nishimura, but then again, they’re children but that also isn’t an excuse to bully someone. However, during the school festival, I love how she was patient in hearing out Nishimura’s plea for her to represent their class and for her to run since Nishimura couldn’t run as fast she could. This scene really showed that Nishimura knew her limits and was willing to ask others to help her despite her want to be with Takada during the relay race. From there, Kasahara started warming up to Nishimura to the point she stopped herself from bullying her, deciding to stay silent instead. \n\nAnimation: The animation is also good, not as high as Mappa or StudioWit, but it’s good enough.\n\nOST: The music is also good enough.\n\nOverall score: It’s a 9/10 for me! I highly recommend this anime if you want your dose of serotonin and wholesomeness!",

        "Your lie in April, a childhood trauma healed by love. I don't think it's worth describing the story of Your Lie in April, as it's well known and appreciated by the majority of the anime community. To put it simply, yes, it's sublime. In terms of visuals, the work is on the whole fairly classic, but it does feature a few performances, notably in the final musical scenes. Yes, this is a work of romance, but don't expect a classic storyline that doesn't dare to say they love each other for 13 episodes, only to reach episode 24 at the first kiss. It's quite clearthat the story's 2 protagonists love each other, but their love develops through their love of music. Some might consider the middle of the piece a bit pointless. I don't consider it dispensable. It's essential to establish the depth of Kousei's relationship with music, a passion tainted by human drama. \nAbove and beyond this romance, which is particularly noticeable at the end of the work, the latter is made special by Kaori's work to heal Kousei's trauma about playing the piano. This journey is completed by the final concert, where Kousei plays for Kaori, her passion and her mother. \n\nYour Lie in April, love is the best medicine.",

      review:
        "Rent-a-Girlfriend is a controversial series that has earned a place as one of the worst popular anime series in recent years. Constantly trashed and treated almost as an offense to human dignity, it has become for a myriad of reasons and without much debate in one of the preferred titles for many when it comes to choosing something hot to easily hatewatch and thus be able to \"prove their good taste” to the rest and fit. It is in this sense -so far- to the 2020s what titles like Elfen Lied and Sword Art Online were to the 2000s and 2010s respectively. However, I can’tdisagree more with this general rejection it has been victim of since, quite the opposite, to my eyes this is one of the most outstanding and memorable modern proposals of recent years (and probably, even the last decade) and as such deserves much better treatment than the one it has received. Now that its third season has just premiered, I thought it would be a good idea to briefly explain why this is.\n\n(Note: what I’m going to point out here refers mainly to the first season, which is in essence only the introduction plus some early development of the series and then should be judged as such and not as a finished work).\n\nTo start, it must be remembered that this is at its core a romantic comedy, more generally a comedy and as such its fundamental mission is to make laugh or awaken feelings of joke within the viewer and provide it a fun experience, something in which the series succeeds in both a remarkable and original way. It takes and revolves around an absurd and unrealistic concept or idea such as “renting a girlfriend”, which may be an activity that actually exists in certain parts of the world but for the common people it is perceived as something simply silly, ridiculous and unthought-of, and is presented in the universe of this series as something real and normal, which is flashy enough to consist in a good hook and makes it worth having a look at. It works with it both smartly and carefully and plays with it dumbly to create unbelievable situations that are hardly seen in real life and bring on reactions of disbelief. However, the absurd and unreal is necessarily something distant, and the series would not work entirely well if it didn’t incorporate into the mix a more realistic component that provides the closeness or identification. This it expresses it through the protagonist, Kazuya Kinoshita, a “loser” college student with low self-esteem and a frustrated romantic life who resorts to renting a girlfriend out of despair after being dumped by his ex-girlfriend after just a month of relationship. It may be that one does not identify with him and his anxieties, but whether or not this is the case the truth is that the series does a very good job at putting us in his shoes, make us feel empathy for him and make us laugh both of him and with him with the series of misadventures and funny situations the series creates for these effects and that he suffers after deciding to present his rental girlfriend as a real girlfriend to his family and friends and refusing to tell the truth. The series works exceptionally well because it takes these two ends of the spectrum, where each is not enough by itself when it comes to delivering a highly effective comedy and combines them in a balanced way to build an exceptional, hilarious, memorable (and maybe even cute) story and experience to the audience as a joke or a game, that doesn’t take itself seriously and that makes us laugh at life and maybe why not, ourselves too. While the unrealistic component provides the interest, the appeal, the realist one provides the familiarization and emotional connection.\n\nFor apparently yet another silly and light romantic comedy, the plot and its development are surprisingly outstanding. I won't go into specific details or examples to not spoil, but another of its strengths lies in that it knows how to identify very well and make the most of all the potential that its premise and chosen tone offer, in terms of all the possibilities that can take place, what can emerge and what can be done with it, through the introduction of new characters, unlikely, tense, uncomfortable or embarrassing situations and/or well-thought-out misunderstandings that are not only very funny but also complicate and make the whole mess in which the protagonist falls increasingly intriguing, making sure at the same time not to stray from its absurd and silly conceptual framework, thus remaining consistent with its own objectives and nature. Thanks to this, it keeps you constantly surprised and stunned from beginning to end of how far the muddle goes seeing how it evolves and becomes more complicated, how everything spirals out of control and how all the involved react in regards to it, and manages as well to keep you permanently hooked interested to know what will happen next and where the whole accumulated mess will end in a genuine way without any effort requirement, which is something that any series should always try to achieve. While admittedly it’s true that the series resorts to hardly believable conveniences, that most of these mentioned situations are somewhat forced and that the whole plot itself originates from a markedly forced event (the fact that Chizuru had decided to follow Kazuya to the hospital when she didn’t have any reason to do it and it is what sets the whole mess in motion), the fact that this is an absurd series allows all this to be easily acceptable without major problems (the case would be evidently different if it were something that targeted to something more serious, but it's not), and furthermore, sometimes it becomes something inevitably necessary to allow a comedy to develop its points and obtain the desired comic reaction from the audience, which is the idea and what the series intends to achieve.\n\nThe protagonist certainly explains a large part of the antibodies that the series generates (if not, all of them). Hated for who he is and what he does, his attitudes, decisions and behaviors (in particular, for doing something as human as masturbating), many consider him to be one of the worst protagonists the media has ever seen, treating him as pathetic, insufferable, simp, perverted and cringey, among many other negative adjectives, and that because of him the entire series is unworthy of anyone's time, something that results curious to me because from this it is inferred that apparently in order to be a good series then the protagonist must be the closest to a perfect human being as possible, something that, by default, does not make it a very interesting protagonist to follow (and would also imply that any series about villains is immediately bad, which is obviously, nonsense). If the series turns out to be more appealing than several others in the genre, it is precisely because it has a protagonist indeed more interesting. He’s not the ideal man, Prince Charming, an alpha male no woman can resist, a womanizer, the popular athletic guy in college, an edgy guy shrouded in mystery who comes off as imposing or intimidating or someone who enjoys a lot of success in life in some area and is both attractive and admired because of that, but a very ordinary guy with quite normal attitudes for his age and social context, insecure of himself, immature, inexperienced, with inferiority complex and sentimentally failed, but all this not to a diametrically opposite degree either because at the same time he does not represent an extreme case of a “loser” and he is not a complete nobody either, which makes him a character far more human and relatable to the majority than virtually all the stereotypes mentioned above. On the other hand, as mentioned before, if the series works well (this is: to be funny) it’s also thanks to him. Together with his characterization that makes him a realistic character (and as such, provides empathy), his particular attitudes, comments, expressions and reactions to all the chaos that he experiences after deciding to rent a girlfriend explain immensely how funny the show is. Finally, some claim that he is a static character who does not show any progress or learn from his mistakes, which makes me wonder if they actually watched the series or not because that is just not the case. Towards the end of the season he becomes more aware of his mistakes, the events that he has lived through after deciding to rent a girlfriend make him reflect on the consequences of his decisions and with this he grows as an individual. Also, it's not like the series finds its ending in this season, so expecting realized characters this fast is both rushed and a mistake.\n\nAnd of course, the series wouldn't be called Rent-a-Girlfriend without the group of girls surrounding the protagonist. While not all of them may be equally important in terms of the impact they have on the story, each of the four sets apart from the other in terms of personalities and motivations, each of the four complicate the protagonist from a different and unique angle, each of the four has a very clear different and defined role to exploit or work with some aspect of it in a certain tone, and each of the four to a certain extent thus contributes in keeping the series versatile and appealing from various perspectives, they complement each other and enrich the story each in their own way. Most of them add to the unrealistic side of the series, in the sense that in real life none of them would place her eyes or be as nice or helpful to someone as Kazuya. (In relation to this, it is noteworthy to see how, for example, the artistic style of their designs is quite different from the masculine ones; while they all look like perfect beautiful dolls, the men have features that are more similar to those of real life). If there's anything wrong here, probably what I would have liked is that they could have been somewhat less supportive and made it harder for the protagonist to get away with his lies and save his ass all the time (especially Chizuru, where the plot demanded her to consent to everything that Kazuya asked or proposed to help him or rescue him from some trouble) since this was perhaps pushed beyond what was needed for the plot to work, but not to the point to make it unbearable either.\n\nFinally, I cannot not refer to the criticism that the series receives in relation to the moral issue of its premise. Many felt offended by it because of presenting the girlfriend-renting service as a normalization of an immoral or unacceptable business and it is wrong that it treats it so lightly only for the lowest class of entertainment purposes instead of addressing it more seriously through a socially critical approach, and some even go as far as accusing it of normalizing and/or promoting prostitution. The truth is, that all this ethical controversy is artificial, pointless and should not suppose any problem, due to the fact that whether renting a girlfriend (or boyfriend, whatever) and everything that the activity implies is something right or not, is something that necessarily depends on the viewer's own values and culture and has no bearing with the internal quality of the series; it is something external to it and then the moral angle is not a criteria to judge it. This becomes more evident when remembering that it is essentially a comedy and an absurd one; by not taking itself seriously, the ethical issue loses all relevance, and had it wanted to explore it, it naturally would not have chosen to be a comedy in the first place. Not to mention, that the series makes it quite clear that the rental service has its strict rules and limits and only consists of offering girls who will accompany their clients on a date in public spaces for a limited time, they will make them have a good time but without getting intimately involved with them and expressly prohibiting all kinds of sexual class interactions, so confusing it with prostitution is not only going too far but is also baseless.\n\nOverall, Rent-a-Girlfriend is an unfortunately underrated, unfairly criticized and misunderstood romantic comedy that has been victim of prejudice, wrong interpretation, insecurity and hate bandwagonism, factors that stop people from enjoying the series for what it is and make them criticize it for what it isn’t and never attempted to be. Regardless of its further development in next seasons, the first season in particular works very well as an introduction and early development by both hooking and keeping engaged the viewer with an original and interesting concept, fun and relatable characters, an addictive direction and in the end executing an exceptionally funny experience based on the absurd, and acknowledging that you enjoyed it will not make you a worse person, won’t make you look immature or pathetic neither some kind of second-class citizen. The season is not a finished work and as such can’t get a higher score, but within its own class and specific comedy objectives, it is highly effective and memorable, very recommendable and deserves a much better treatment than the one it has received.",

      review:
        "Note: I'm writing this with the assumption the reader has finished Tetsujin 28-gou 2004 before watching the movie, so spoilers for the show are going to be mentioned a lot. Yasuhiro Imagawa is a legend among mecha fans, the combination of his strong narratives and love for classic old school robots lead to his reboots of old properties being considered on par if not superior to the originals, and his 2004 version of 60s anime Tetsujin 28-gou is no exception. By combining a magnificent retro aesthetic, epic orchestral OST, a likable cast with great chemistry, solid character development and strong thematic writing, it's easily one ofthe most overlooked mecha shows I've watched. Needless to say, this movie doesn't live up to the standard set by its predecessor, and there's just way too many reasons why.\n\nLet's start with the elephant in the room, there's no way this movie is canon, between Ryuusaku being inexplicably alive, Kenji being reformed and the Velanede group apparently being unknown to the main cast, there's no point in the series' timeline the events of this movie can take place in. If that wasn't enough, it also retcons a lot of the stuff we knew about Kaneda, not only with these new Ruin Bombs and the way they completely contradict what we knew about the Tetsujin Project, but also introducing Shotaro's older brother of the same name, whom I'm going to call Shoutarou from here on. Shoutarou's entire existence undermines Kaneda's motivation for creating Tetsujin 28, as he wanted the robot to serve as a replacement for his unborn child that he believed to be dead, so him actually already having another son makes what the series had established about Tetsujin that served as the basis for the relationship between it and Shotaro to no longer make sense - something the movie itself seems to acknowledge, as Shotaro has to go by the same arc he went in the first 5 eps of this series in this for no explicable reason.\n\nGoing back to things that have no explanation, let's go back to the fact a lot of characters are just completely out of character, from Takamizawa suddenly becoming a shotacon (fun trivia, this Shotaro is the origin of the word irl, and we even see her coining the term early into the movie), Kenji being very open about his love for her and showing none of his grislier side, Big Fire and Velanede wanting to blow up Japan for no clear motivation, and Chloroform, who had been little more than a prop for Shikishima in the series but was at worst a jerk cop from what we saw of him, acting as the main antagonist who's even viler than the previously mentioned duo. While the trio of Shotaro, Otsuka and Shikishima aren't ooc, they lack any of the depth they had in the series, so they still come across as flat compared to their original nuanced portrayal. Tetsujin itself was treated as a character with its own arc and themes in the series, and yet, it's just a plot device here, effectively only being in the movie because it's in the title. All the antagonistic mecha from the show also come back, again with no explanation, and they're defeated with no fanfare.\n\nMusic and animation are as good as in the show, but this is a movie, the fact it looks the same as a TV series is plain bizarre. There's also some footage recycled from the series, and even from the movie itself, during the fight scenes, but at least the latter had a plot reason. If anything, the advantage the movie had was lacking the TV restrictions, so they could show Shotaro indulging in more adult content like drinking alcohol, bleeding and even using the gun that had been forbidden from being added by exces. From the staff list, I can tell the writers changed, and I heard Imagawa didn't like how this movie turned out, and it's clear that he just wasn't that into it, as his dramatic cinematography is barely present throughout.\n\nOverall, this movie adds nothing that the series didn't do already, derails a good chunk of the cast, trivializes all the antagonists, and in general just feels like it would've been better to just make it a sequel rather than the weird alt timeline stuff going on here.\n\nThank you for reading",

        "The first episode sucks, BUT KEEP WATCHING. If you're looking for a relatively chill anime, this one might be for you. While the first episode is certainly boring, the rest of the series does not feel that way at all. More episodic in nature, the four central characters bring us along with their good-natured vibes and natural chemistry together. There are definitely some humorous moments and gags that are very enjoyable. Know what you're signing up for. This is an iyashikei (peaceful lives in calming environments) slice-of-life. If that's what you're looking for, then give this a go. -------------Random Notes--------------- Weak first episode. Fails to answer the question,\"Why are we joining the story here? What is its significance?\" Definitely aims to be an iyashikei (sub-genre of slice of life) but it could be more peaceful and calm. The characters are more rambunctious than you might want. \n\nSpeaking of characters, they don't introduce a single one in-depth in the first episode. They are just four \"hot\" dudes with cliche archetypes and a random working lady? (srsly who dis random lady?)\n\nThere is a distinct lack of sound effects + background noise over a select few shots and/or the animation does not match the voiceover work. It's quite noticeable and when it happens it will completely take you out of the show. But it is rare.\n\nWithout a doubt, eps 6 was originally intended to be the first episode but whoever is in charge decided it was too boring as a first episode... So instead they choose another boring episode to start the series? Doesn't make sense.\n\nEpisode 8 is kinda boring.\n\nI'll give it a 7 but probably closer to a 6 than an 8.",

      review:
        "This was the show that made me grow an aprreciation for anime. My cousin recommended this show to me, but I was very reluctant at first because I had never been interested in anime before. But one day, I opened my mind, I watched the first episode just to see if it was worth watching and I ended up wacthing the entire thing. I was reall surprised with how good it was. Not only is this one of the best anime ever made, it's one of the best shows ever made. It's the only anime I would put up there alongside Breaking Bad andChernobyl.\n Where can I possibly start? The story is phenomenal. It's full of genius foreshadowing which increases the show's rewatchability. It starts off with a simple premise about humans being attacked by titans and it gets progressively more complex (and depressing) as you go on. I also never felt lime I was being given too much information. The prime example of this is immediately the first episode, where you're only given the information you need to start watching the show and become invested in it. The information that's not immediately necessary has its seeds planted early in the story and is then presented in a way that doesn't feel forced. The prime example of this is the genre shift between seasons 3 and 4.\n The soundtrack is also one of the best I've ever heard, and «Vogel Im Kafig» is probably my new favorite song.\n The characters are also great, and that's including Mikasa. I understand that people don't like Mikasa because she's too attached to Eren and does nothing but worry about him, but that really didn't bother me. Considering her backstory, it makes perfect sense for her to be that way.\n I don't wanna give away too many details about this show. If you haven't watched it yet, I have a question: What are you waiting for?",

      review:
        "It's a good movie, but considering how much I was looking forward to watch it, it was a very underwhelming experience. The main reason why I wanted to watch it was because of the concept. The idea of a city growing infinitely and the characters having to stop its growth was something I had never seen tried in anything and I'm always a fan of giving a crazy idea a chance. I had also heard that the Blame! manga was one of the best, if the best manga ever made, so I really watched this movie expecting something memorable. Then I watched and myimmediate issue was the 3D animation. I know some people actually like the 3D animation in this movies, but it really didn't work for me, sorry.\n Another issue is that the story is mainly an action sci-fi survival adventure. I was expecting something more ambitious than that, especially considering that, according to manga readers, the manga focuses a lot on megalophobia inducing imagery, making the main characters look extremely small and making it seem like the characters are in an endless labyrinth.\n But despite all its issues, I'm not saying this movie is bad. It's good, I enjoyed it, I was just pretty underwhelmed.",

        "Last episode: pretty good Rest of the show: not so good Honestly, they needed more fanservice. Like the soypoint \"oh wow that's so wacky but cool\" kinda fanservice. I know it's adapting source material, but like, for a sidestory, man could they have made it more indulgent. I couldn't tell you what happens in each episode. There's basically kid Megumin, school, hot springs town, then starting village. Nothing that happens in each one matters. I wonder if this prequel is even required watching since it doesn't look like the villains are reoccurring. Anyways, it's been such a long gap since the original I don't remember it. Skill issueI guess.",

      review:
        "Mou Ippon! is a pretty generic sports anime. It doesn't try reinventing the wheel, but nothing is necessarily wrong. It's just that not a single aspect of the show stands out, and thus becomes highly mediocre. By playing it safe, the show suffers. The problem is that this show has not a single thing that draws the viewer in. Let's first talk about the sport itself, Judo. Usually, when a show regarding a sport shows up, it should at least give a tutorial on the sport; the rules, how to play Judo, and stuff like that. This show doesn't do that. Okay, fine, but will thefocus of the show be Judo? Well, Yes, and no. Compared to pure sports shows, it clearly has much less focus. There are no training regiments, and no real strategies other than observing the opponent's previous matches. The animation of the judo is a bit stiff and there are freeze frames, but overall, the animation is alright. It's just that there's not too much monologuing, but the matches themselves are long enough. It's not just someone \"throwing\" them down and that's the match. However, it's also not enough to carry the show. After all, there's no real \"training\" being done. A lot of the daily life of the schoolgirls is focused on training, but on what? Again, not too much strategy, not much of any focus on the actual sport of Judo. This gets reflected in the opponents themselves. You can see the lack of focus on the characters when you notice that opponents don't get an introduction. The show tries to characterize them mid-match, and it kind of works successfully, too, but again, just not enough to carry the show. Flashback no jutsu isn't going to magically develop a new opponent.\n\nWhat about the main characters themselves? Again, they're all not bad. You have the shy captain that wants to improve themself while also taking care of the team, the bombastic protagonist, a reclusive expert Judoka that eventually learns to express their feelings, the best friend character that switches from an all-star kendo player to Judo in order to be with the protagonist, the senior that wants to make their last year count and a reliable coach that helps them along the way. There's nothing wrong with them, but when you don't actually see them train, their monologues, they can't carry the show. \n\nBamboo Blade, a similar show about Kendo instead of Judo, suffers the same flaws. There's a clear focus on Kendo, but it does feel a bit weak still, but there is also an equal amount of focus on slice-of-life interactions and comedy. This slice of life aspect makes up for the sort of whimsical focus on Kendo. So unlike Bamboo Blade, Mou Ippon lacks this slice-of-life interaction that Bamboo Blade does, which made it stand out more. \n\nIt's okay for this show to focus entirely on Judo, which it does, but it needs to be perfected. If Ookiku Furikabutte, a similar show that focuses entirely on baseball with a grassroots high school level team that wants to go to nationals shows so much more detail in character development, the training, and the matches themself despite having a 9-player roster, a manager, and a coach, then there's a problem.",

        "There are no coincidences. If you're right here and Right Now reading this, there's a reason, a logical cause; but not always a clear first principle or motiff. That's when Art can give us a little push. Haibane Renmei is a very earthy, soft anime with an ethereal touch. The settings, characters, pace, and the (beautiful) music transport you and made feel the love present in the every day unimportant things of life and the world. Sure, their \"handmade\" craftsmanship is shown. Different people have different tastes, and we all have different needs. I have experienced how work's like this can have a profound effect on thedeep consciousness or psyche, meanwhile others (some friends as example), can simple pass on that, like was nothing. The world is a mysterious place, and the most mysterious of their corners is the human hearth.\n\nIf you're lucky enough, like I am, this show will change something inside of you for the better. That's all.",

Storyline is giving very cultish vibes and is just not really interesting and there doesn't seem to be much growth both in characters and fighting skills. Any level up is just something they are born with and unlock and I really hate when people don't really earn what they have. If that is the case they should at least have to work hard to master it. Show had nice animation and hype but no substance.",

        "THE BEST ANIME EVER! I watched this show like 2 years ago but i remember almost all the story details and everything. And from the 1st episode of the anime I understood that this was the perfect anime for me. Art: 10 Characters: 10 Sounds: 10 Story: 10 Masterpiece... Others may not like this anime but I think the characters are so good even they're not realistic. Keyaru is the strongest and smartest character I've ever seen. The story was so unique, there are too many plot twists at the anime and the art style really fit the story and the universe.",

        "A Romance with likable characters this is a feel-good show. With a little light comedy to support the major romance tones this is definitely a comfort show. Knowing that the manga has over a hundred chapters more story and is still growing I'm left wondering if this show will have a satisfactory conclusion on the anime side. However, if you are looking for a cute romance with little to no drama than this will hit the spot. The art style is standard and unremarkable. The most refreshing part for me how they approach the relationship which explores the relationship in anunusual way.",

      review:
        'Grand Blue Dreaming. This was a really nice show. I am a heavy heavy comedy anime enjoyed. I live off comedy animes. Sometimes jokes get stale. Sometimes I do not laugh, but here I laugh most of the time. There is a lot of alcohol involved though. THis is the quintessential Teen anime show though.Story: About Iori who moved into town. He "joins" the Dive club, a weird club with a bunch of big burly men roaming around naked in the dive shop. Weird premise right?\n\nBut they go with it. Surprisingly, it works. One of the better comedy animes I\'ve seen for sure.\n\nThe arcs were nice. My favorite was the Tennis Club arc with the Tennis game.\n\nComedy is subjective but it is good here.\n\nAnimation: It is good animation. 2018 was 5 years ago wow! But it still has amazing animation my only concern is the stylistic choices they made in that it is not really unique. \n\nBut the underwater scenes were beautiful so there is that.\n\nThe music: OP was pretty good not the best. Skipped it most of the time.\n\nConsensus: It is a nice comedic anime that you should watch.\n\nFinal Score: 8/10 it is good. Context: Daily lives of High School Boys was a 9 and Asobi Asobase/Azumanga Daioh was a 10.\n\nThanks!\n-CyanCheetah',

        "Oh well I randomly decided to do this on a whim because this anime had a profound effect on me. As in, it actually made me think about the stuff that is happening, why its happening, who is responsible etc. I really have a soft spot for anime that make me question why I'm even watching them in the first place (Like Serial experiments Lain aswell) Maybe most of you have seen it already, Maybe most of you havent even heard about it but regardless it has quite a bit of historical value in that it actually had a really bold ending which I wont spoil obviouslylmao.\n\nStory :(5)\nJust your run of the mill harem romance school story, Below average actually.\n\nCharacters :(5)\nThe characters are well... Extremely selfish and maybe life like? Idk how to describe it but I hated almost all the characters near the end and imo that speaks volumes about the writing atleast. \n\nAnimation :(5)\nExtremely average\n\nMusic :(8)\nNow this is where the anime somewhat excels , Had some really good songs here and there and the way they used them was nice.\n\nEnjoyment:(8)\nNow you're probably thinking why would I rate this an 8 because its average rating is somewhere around 5.5 something.\nI rate an anime based on, beginning, music, how many times it made me question stuff, or had some impact or some moments which I might not forget and lastly the ending and boy does this have one of the most satisfying endings I've seen in anime recently. \n\nIf anyone has seen it dont spoil in the comments because its one of those anime where you should go completely blind and see for yourself.\nDo not google it or anything, Just start watching\n\nIf you read all that, Thanks!\nHere's a cookie 🍪",

        "---Original language: Portuguese--- ---Additional language: English--- English: I recently discovered part 2 of this anime and honestly guess it was better than part one. Something that had bothered me a lot was the bad explanation of the past, I still wonder if it was a good idea to have left it for part 2 Anyway, this drama and portrayal of the war gave me a good feeling I don't know why, this ending was until good The descent of our protagonists correspond to our wills which makes it in my view good, for sharing ideals The anime is good to pass the time and I don't know if there willbe a sequel, but if it does, I recommend seeing it for sure.\nAnd all this impacts on the final grade, this time it was to: 8/10\nI even come to pronounce that prioritizing English over my native language is unfortunate, but I do not want my opinion deleted, thank you all for reading\n\nPT-BR: Recentemente descobri a parte 2 desse anime e sinceramente adimito que foi melhor qua a parte um.\nAlgo que tinha me incomodado bastante era a má explicação do passado, ainda me pergunto se foi uma boa ideia ter deixado para a parte 2\nenfim, esse drama e retratação da guerra me trouxe um sensação boa não sei porque, esse final foi até que bom\nA tomada de descisão dos nossos protagonistas correspondem as nossa vontades o que torna na minha visão bom, por compartilhar ideais\no anime é bom para passar o tempo e não sei se haverá continuação, mas se tiver, recomendo ver com certeza.\ne tudo isso impacta na nota final, dessa vez foi para: 8/10\nVenho até me pronunciar que priorizar o ingles ao inves da minha lingua natal é lamentavel, porem nao quero te minha opinião excluida, obrigado a todos por ler",

      review:
        "I'll judge the first 2 seasons on this review). What can I say about 86? It's a must-see! Let's talk about the obvious. 86 is sublime in its animation. Whether it's the fight scenes, the landscapes, the quieter moments, the details, the characters, the cities, the robots, ... Everything is well done, there are no mistakes, everything is successful. The work is sublime. The scene that most illustrates this beauty is clearly the one in the rose field. Now that we've talked image, let's talk story. It's very well told. Right from the start, we see the social class system present in society between the \"grayhairs\" and the others. We understand Milizé's ambitions in relation to the latter. The author makes this very interesting, as Milizé's desire to create friendship is not directly accepted by his troops. They're not dumb characters who don't distrust nice people. What's more, despite the relationship that gradually develops. Certain tragic events remind the heroes of the story that this friendship is only very fragile. \nIt will obviously grow stronger with each battle and discussion. The Handler gradually manages to shake the Reaper out of his natural coldness and seriousness. If you want to talk a little about season 2, take a look at the adventure surrounding Frederica Rosenfort. Some may find her useless and unbearable at first, but the ending will make you forget all that very quickly.",

      review:
        "\"Bleach\" was unlucky to come out when there are many alternative Shounen that are all like two identical drops of water. There are a lot of interesting characters in Bleach, funny dramatic ones, the characters die there, it's still frankly a teenage title, but he has iron balls in terms of acting dramaturgy... but this is mainstream, now all shounen will look like this. I read manga as a teenager and I'm glad the anime came out, but I'm honest with you there's nothing special about it. the art style is good, but not more, the animation is acceptable, but I know what can be better the music isgood, but I wouldn't listen to it separately on repeat\n\nthis title has one big plus there are few fillers and a lot of action\n\nwell, there's probably an interesting lore of the entire franchise, but I spread my hands and can't advise, it's exclusively for fans\n\nwell, this is a very straightforward quotation of manga, personally I think that a good anime adaptation of manga should be a good ANIME... in manga, there is a special genre where the characters pronounce their actions so that the reader can understand what is happening, in a good anime adaptation this should not be, anime works a little differently, there are pictures moving and you need to show and not tell. the adaptation should complement the manga and not quote it\n\nin fact, I'm lying, the fact is that in manga fights are vague garbage and anime looks more interesting, this is not an achievement of adaptation, but rather a bad manga... yes, I understand that I'm climbing into a bottle, but this is such a genre here just a good Shounen is not enough",

      review:
        "Rating: 6 This would have done just as good if it was a live-action anime since they drop all what makes, anime - anime. If you read the manga and watched the anime, this is a completely different story. Where the anime and manga are able to present to us all characters equally, the movie lacks and presents most characters in a hollow way. Music is fine but many times it was awkardly silent to make the anime seem like a real basketball game. They are playing a championship, yet there is a lack of background sound/music plus there is ZERO cheering which makes it seemlike an empty crowd when in fact it is full. \nThey make it fast paced and realistic only to ruin it with plenty of flashbacks and occassional slow-motion. If they decided on using slow-motion they could've used it several other times to create tension in the game (as they did on the anime and manga). Since they use plenty of flashbacks, it ruins the pace and tension of the game. \nThe rivals and the rivalry seem empty and the Shohoku (the protagonist team) seems empty too. \n\nAll that aised, it is good if you want to learn a bit more about Miyagi Ryouta in the whole series. I would say this movie would have done better if it focused on Ryouta the whole movie rather than compromising and failing at all. OR they could've introduce all his background at the beginning and shown the game afterwards (including more sound too). The story is nice, but if you are trying to look for Slam Dunk, this is not it. \n\n I love Slam Dunk for it's cheering atmostphere no matter how grim it might seem. All the character's interaction in the team seem so wholesome and funny (in the anime and manga). Ryouta blushes everytime when Ayako talks to him and smiles. The movie took this off and made them too serious even the way (former main character with red hair) Sakuragi interacts seems off putting. \nI do apreciate the bold new approach, but this could've done better in several areas. A 40min OVA could've done better. \nI will watch it again to focus on Miyagi Ryouta but my main complaints still stand. \n-lack of sound/music\n-hollow characters\n-awkard interactions",

        "The CGI Resident Evil films in my opinion were always WAY more miss than hit and the only people that liked them or at least were willing to look past their massive issues due to their love for the characters were huge fans of the Resident Evil IP . Up until now I can't say that I've liked any of these original stories all that much beyond the novelty of \"Oh look there's Rebecca , Sure haven't seen her in a while!\" but Death Island was a surprisingly enjoyable pop corn flick Now don't get me wrong the bar wasn't set very high with Vendettaand especially Infinite Darkness but I found the action to be well choreographed and the animation to be pretty good overall . They tried to do some interesting things here with Jill's PTSD of sorts after the events of Resident Evil 5 and the main villain actually calling out how hypocritical and ineffectual the main cast of this series has been but nothing gets enough time in the oven and overall both plot points disappoint \n\nNobody will or should see this film expecting masterful writing or complex character motivations . This is nothing but a fanservice movie where damn near all the fan favorites come together (I do miss old Jill though but new one is fine) to defeat yet another bio-terror threat and that's all there is to it\n\nRecommend it to Resident Evil fans and nobody else",

        "The Anime is basically how Women think. The problems and inter personal relationship they face are not complicated or serious, yet they portray it as veeeery complicated, they show as if there is a problem in stupid and casual scenarios. I definitely do not recommend this anime to anyone. 10 billion percent bullshit. Please watch some psychological thriller or something else instead of wasting your time in this bullshit. This anime will be definitely sympathised by most women because stuff they talk about are definitely the kind of topic my mother shouts about all day to my father. The art style and character designs are fabulous andgorgeous and the reason I started watching this anime. It is definitely a huuge waste to have such good art and animation to this piece of garbage. The budget and work should've been invested in anime's like Wotakoi or Grand Blue😞😞. \n\nOverall this anime is definitely does not have any proper suspense or mystery or any likable factor. I'm suuuper surprised that this garbage is rated 8+. I'd personally like to have a word with every person who rated this anime more than 4. A complete waste of time.",

        "I honestly do not like the song at all, there's something about the percussion that gives me a headache and everything feels choppy, compressed, and over-mixed. However, the music video itself is wonderful, it reminds me of old children's books. It's a shame that such a pretty video is attached to this song. I'd recommend watching the video with the song muted, but if that ruins the experience for you then I'd say don't watch it at all. uhhhh ok so the site wants me to add more stuff, uhhh \"Do you think the art style is fitting for the story?\" No, it's not, again Ithink the art is too good for this video. \"Were the characters well-rounded?\" Well they were certainly playful and imaginative, I think those are good characteristics. \"Did the characters react to situations and events in a realistic way?\" As best they could, yeah.\n\nIs that good enough? I think that's good enough.",

        "This is a really good romcom that I would recommend to any enjoyer of the genre. It's a lot of fluff and there is like 0 drama so if you want some spice or something then this is not for you I guess. Anyways, the series focuses on a prim and proper girl(not really but that's how ml describes here) and a delinquent boy(but not really), and they have differing interests but are both interested in each other and try to get closer to each other. Unfortunately at the start this is kind of mixed in success, but then they get closer and it's good.The series is very cute, and if this seems like something that would interest you I recommend it. Though if you don't like this type of manga which is probably most people then move on I guess, which is why this has like a 7/10 I suppose (its 10/10 in my heart)",

      review:
        "At first glance, Kimi to Pico-Pico is a story about a video game otaku suddenly finding himself in the same gaming club as a gyaru brought up on classical NES titles. Looking at it from a broader perspective, it's a story that’s less about the video games themselves and more about the gamers. Old school gamers, competitive gamers, even gamers modding their peripherals or trying to make their own short works in the Game Maker. Of course, it’s also a rom-com filled with references to Japanese computer games. At its core, Kimi to Pico-Pico is a comedy about video games first, even if Japanese peculiarities abouteffective lack of fair use force them to use very blatant ersatzes for many game titles. We get jokes about searching for easter eggs, trying to circumvent modesty shadows to peek under skirts of 3D models and people pointing out the inherent hilarity of the existence of a co-op video game wholly based around parodying stereotypical Japanese politeness. The games referenced are varied, though the series has clear bias towards both the older titles and the works seen as iconic or at least peculiar enough to warrant their mention. Overall, I’m pretty sure that the wide variety of game related topics and jokes will reach anybody with interest in them, even if some references will likely send you for a wiki crawl.\n\nAs for the second pillar of comedy in this series, our gamers, the series doesn’t disappoint either. Characters are both vivid enough to perform their comedic roles and down to earth enough to be relatable. Without spoiling the later developments, the main cast consists of four characters: our main duo of Taichi Oota, introverted gamer otaku and Ageha Onisaki, gyaru girl who got into gaming playing with her father on NES, and the secondary couple of their two seniors at club. The most important thing to know about them is that they have great chemistry, especially the main couple. It’s refreshing to see romantic leads of the series genuinely enjoy each other’s presence this much, especially since it makes their slow progress towards becoming a couple much more believable.\n\nIt’s worth pointing out that this comedy makes full use of both quid pro quo misunderstandings and dramatic exaggerations showing us games from the perspective of the already immersed characters. This gives this series decent levels of fanservice and innuendos, while usually keeping it from overtaking the plot. Though I personally felt like one fanservice arc in the middle was a bit too long and a bit too on the nose with suggestive, exaggerated expressions. I particularly enjoy the fact that Kimi to Pico-Pico occasionally ventures out with its jokes outside the realm of gaming, providing a pleasant and refreshing change of pace.\n\nIf I were to point out the series' main weak point, I’d say it’s the feeling that the ending felt a little compressed, like the series needed two more chapters to properly finish the denouncement. Still, I consider it as distinctly above average with how the series handles it, especially compared to the unfortunate tendency of rom-com manga series to end right at their emotional zenith. While this vague description doesn’t do the series justice, it’s the most detailed one I can give without revealing the key details of the plot.\n\nOverall, I believe that Kimi to Pico-Pico is a masterpiece of a nerd culture rom-com manga. I can honestly rate it 10/10 and recommend it to others.",

        "tl;dr: A hilarious spin off of Nisekoi that has fun playing around with magical girl tropes and such. This manga is a magical girl spin off of Nisekoi that’s based on the short mini-chapters found at the end of some of the volumes of Nisekoi. It’s essentially a parallel world where everyone gets involved with magic girls one way or another. It’s satirical in a sense in that it plays with a lot of the tropes. It’s pretty funny and is constantly adding new things at a fast enough pace that it never feels like it’s getting repetitive or dull, though with it being only fourvolumes I suppose that was nowhere near as difficult to accomplish as with the main series. It does have a serious plot which ultimately culminates in the standard magical girl messages, such as the value of courage and friendship. This plot is pretty generic though, and not something I think is all that good on it’s own.\n\nThe real draw of this manga is in how it uses the cast from Nisekoi is new ways. It does a really good job of taking all the elements from Nisekoi such as personalities, relationships, etc. and have them fit into the typical magical girl storyline. Characters are somewhat different from the main series, but for the most part I think they’re translated pretty well such that a fan of a character in Nisekoi would enjoy seeing them in a new light in this manga. The protagonist this time around is also clearly Onodera, so fans of her are especially likely to enjoy the increased focus on her. The one characters that’s changed to a bizarre degree is Ichijou, who’s pretty much a completely different character with the same name, but I suppose it was necessary as Nisekoi Ichijou wouldn’t really fit the male lead role in a magical girl story well at all.\n\nThe art of this manga I also found more interesting than in Nisekoi. The quality is about the same and the art style is also very similar, but it’s more fantastical so it’s able to do a lot more in terms of more interesting designs and such, especially with outfits. There’s also a pretty big emphasis on fanservice, which considering there was essentially none in Nisekoi results in having a very different feel.",

        "Goodbye, Eri is a captivating and multifaceted manga that enthralls its readers with unexpected twists and turns. It masterfully weaves a narrative around death, employing it as a driving motive that takes us on an exhilarating journey. Yet, as we delve deeper into its intricacies, we find ourselves exploring inception-like realms of reality, where distinguishing between what's real and what isn't becomes an engrossing guessing game. Romantic elements tinge the story, but they are far from easily definable. Instead, they weave an enigmatic tapestry that leaves us pondering the complexities of love and its many facets. And just when we think we've grasped the essence ofthe story, the ending cleverly embraces ambiguity, much like the iconic movie Inception, allowing the reader to choose their own interpretation of the tale's conclusion.\n\nThroughout the manga, we're compelled to question the very essence of the story. Is it about vampires? Or perhaps about two young souls entwined in love? Maybe it's a tale of a solitary boy coping with profound loss. But then again, is it even a story in the conventional sense?\n\nYet, these musings about the setting become almost inconsequential when we realize that what truly matters is the underlying essence of the narrative. It's a story about relationships, beautifully infused with a \"pinch of fantasy\" that elevates the entire experience to new heights.\n\nIn conclusion, Goodbye, Eri is a thought-provoking and artfully crafted manga that transcends traditional storytelling. Its enigmatic nature keeps us engaged, and its theme of relationships imbues the tale with a timeless allure. A must-read for anyone seeking a unique and captivating manga experience.",

        "Highly recommend. 腐蝕 is one of the best (and personal favorite) tomboy artists. Picked this one up from the Mandarake complex in Akihabara and I'm so glad I got it. Wonderful art, beautiful women and nice wholesome stories. My guy has the same taste in women as I do and I respect him for it. The manga is separated into several stores, all of which have to relation to one another. The characters feel real and well developed considering the length of each story oly being around 10-15 pages. You can really feel the personalities of the characters and that really adds to the overallexperience of reading a doujinshi in my opinion. If you like tall, athletic women with short hair strong personalities this is definitely the one for you. I hope that one day 腐蝕 will get the recognition he/she deserves.",

      review:
        "Tokyo Revengers - An Intriguing Tale of Time, Fate, and Redemption Tokyo Revengers, a manga penned by an enigmatic author, weaves a compelling narrative that ventures into the complexities of time travel and its profound impact on human destiny. With its innovative time leap premise, the story grips readers from the outset, exploring themes of second chances, self-discovery, and the indomitable human spirit. At its core, Tokyo Revengers delves into the transformation of its protagonist, Takemichi Hanagaki, a seemingly ordinary individual burdened by regrets and missed opportunities. As he embarks on a journey through time, we witness his evolution from a timid and uncertain young maninto a tenacious figure, determined to rewrite his past and forge a brighter future.\n\nThe character development in this manga is a true highlight, with each persona meticulously crafted and layered. Not only does Takemichi undergo a profound metamorphosis, but the supporting cast also undergoes their own growth, mirroring the complexities of human nature and interwoven relationships.\n\nVisually, Tokyo Revengers showcases a distinctive art style that effectively captures the emotions and dynamics of the story. The action sequences are rendered with finesse, imbuing the battles with a palpable intensity that resonates with readers. Additionally, the character designs exude authenticity, further immersing readers in the world of Tokyo Revengers.\n\nWhile the first two-thirds of the manga maintain a strong and engaging narrative, the latter arcs introduce new complexities that may leave some readers yearning for a more cohesive resolution. The intricate time travel mechanics, while thought-provoking, may at times challenge the readers' ability to fully grasp the implications of each twist and turn.\n\nIn reflection, while Tokyo Revengers offers a captivating and emotionally resonant journey, some readers, myself included, had hoped for a different ending that diverged from the dark and tragic turn it took. The final arc's conclusion, where Mikey-kun succumbs to a demon curse, left me yearning for a more uplifting resolution.\n\nWith such a rich and intricate storyline, the possibilities for a satisfying finale seemed endless. Instead of succumbing to a curse, I envisioned a conclusion where the characters discovered that their battles were fueled by deeper motivations like pride, friendship, or a desire to protect their loved ones. Such an ending would have provided a more profound sense of closure and showcased the characters' growth and resilience.\n\nNevertheless, it is important to acknowledge that storytelling is an art form, and endings can be a subjective matter. The impact and emotions stirred by Tokyo Revengers' finale are undeniable, even if it didn't align with my personal expectations. It is a testament to the manga's ability to elicit strong feelings and provoke contemplation.\n\nIn the end, while I yearned for a different ending, I still wholeheartedly appreciate the journey Tokyo Revengers took me on. It serves as a reminder that, just like in life, stories can take unexpected turns, and the true beauty lies in the emotions and reflections they evoke in each reader.\n\nOverall, Tokyo Revengers remains a profound and thought-provoking manga that will stay with its readers long after the final page is turned. It is a testament to the power of storytelling and the impact it can have on our hearts and minds.\n\n the good character development and compelling themes make this manga a worthwhile journey for fans of both action and introspective storytelling.\n\nOverall Rating: 7.8/10",

      review:
        "\"Hikaru no Go\" is a manga that's been around for over 20 years. But it still feels fresh and exciting today. The drawings and stories are still amazing. I just started reading it and I wish I had done so sooner. At first, I wasn't interested because it's about 'Go (碁)', a game that older people often play in Japan. If you haven't read it because of that, I hope this review will change your mind. This manga is very inspiring. It's about Hikaru, Toya, and many young Go players. Seeing them grow and improve makes me want to try new things too. Reading this manga makes mefeel like I should stop making excuses and start doing more.\n\nThe drawings in this manga are really good. The Go boards and Stones and the characters' fingers are drawn in detail. You can even tell who a character is just by looking at their hands. This shows how much respect Sensei has for the game of Go.\n\nMy favorite character is Kurata. He's a bit full of himself and says what he wants, which can make him seem like a kid at times. But that's what makes him so interesting.\n\n\"Hikaru no Go\" is not just about a game. It's a story about growing, trying hard, and following your passion. Even if you don't like Go, you might still enjoy this manga. It's inspiring and fun to read.",

      review:
        "A Girl Downstairs, is a romance story of a college student, who surprisingly meets a girl who lives downstairs. With no explicit content, The Chemistry between the lead pairs is soo amazing and great and is what attracted me the most. The story progresses smoothly and all the characters introduced in the series were developed as the story goes on. All the important characters have personalities that may be liked or disliked at first, but at the end, we love most of them. The story is definitely solid part of the manhwa and once you start reading you will get to feel the love, affection,pain, sarcasm, and all the emotions and feelings of the characters. Truly, I started the manhwa after watching 4 eps of anime, and became one of my favorite manhwa. But, the only thing I didn't liked is - ?!\n\nIf you enjoy romance-based stories, I would definitely recommend reading the manhwa. I finished reading the manhwa and it is one of my favorite as of now, So I will rate the manhwa a 10/10.",

      review:
        "Not a couple, not friends, not mother and son, not siblings… We have Satoko, a 30 year-old office lady who suffers from loneliness and doesn’t feel satisfied with her life in any way. On the other hand we have Mashuu, a 12 year-old boy who feels ostracized in school and determined to practice and improve his soccer skills which is the only thing to hold onto in his life. What makes this manga so unique is the way balances are created and maintained in the relationship between the main characters throughout the story. How many manga do you think exist out there that either doesn’t defineor couldn’t define the relation between two people? It just sounds impossible, but it's in fact happens in this manga. When they become gradually involved with each other, I bet you’ll find yourself immersed in this odd and warm relationship, and feel like supporting their future. Even if the ending might kind of leave you disappointed since it doesn’t have a proper conclusion, the mangaka’s success about keeping the balances in the relationships must be greatly appreciated.\n\nIndividual thoughts, feelings, behaviors and so many details about human psychology are expressed astonishingly beautiful on just two-dimensional papers, and that’s the reason I’ve decided to write this review actually. Many psychological elements are amazingly presented in this manga, like portrayal of mental pain of past traumas and confrontation with them, development of high empathy, true forgiveness towards yourself and others, etc.\n\nIf you seek psychological depth in the manga you read, then you should really give it a try.",

        "Personally In my opinion, The story was both PEAK and WHOLESOMEEE , not forget to mention about both the amazing drawings and the storyline was 🔛🔝‼️I love these kinds of stories where the male is just a normal office guy working in the same company for years and he was chosen to be the mentor for Kana (aka the girl on the cover ofc)! He’s definitely a great mentor tho! because he was being patient with her in her early weeks while just started working in the same company with sosuke (the male lead) and no matter how many mistakes she did in the job,he told her that its okay while smiling! But most importantly, they’re just so cute together and it’s so WHOLESOMEE I LOVE ITTT!! I don’t know about y’all but this one is definitely one of my favorite wholesome Doujinshi for now!! easily 10/10 from me &lt;3 \n\nI’m Looking forward to the next work from the same Author!!",

      review:
        "Jagaaan is... a mixed bag. The first half is off-the-rails crazy. Our main character is a homicidal maniac, working as a police officer in the hopes that he can shoot up people he deems as scum to society (whether that's a comment on police brutality or not is up to interpretation). And then magical frogs rain from the sky, people turn into horrifying monsters, and our beat cop gets the superpower to turn his dominant hand to a gun as a result. The early chapters are slow, but it sets the tone for what the series was supposed to be. Twisted people turn into manifestations oftheir desire, and it's really not pretty. The body horror is drawn beautifully, creating just the right mix of ugly and cool. And our main character is thrown into the mix, because he has to fight other monsters to retain his humanity. \n\nHow? He gets his magical bird mascot character to eat their frog-hearts and shit it out, then he snorts said ball of dung like coke. It's incredible. Like a magical girl from my fever dreams. \n\nUnfortunately, symptoms of Jagaaan's problems start to pop up this early. The series like to introduce side-characters that we focus on as a sort of B-plot, and none of them are even remotely enjoyable even as a \"break\". The first one is a rapist who probably only exists as an excuse to draw sex scenes. The second one is a guy stuck in a woman's body who probably also only exists as an excuse to draw sex scenes. You get the idea.\n\nAfter the hilariously named Deader Land arc is where these issues start to worsen. I heard the artist injured his shoulder, so it's not something I can really blame him on, but the art does take a noticeable quality dive. The unique art style and its ugly, inhumane expressions gradually fade away to something more generic. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the designs of the monsters; while still cool, they really don't retain the same level of body horror that they used to have. \n\nSomehow the B-plot continues to be stupidly meaningless, and everything is tied up rather haphazardly by the end with some trite philosophical debates and monologues about the meaning of life. Still, Jagaaan's strongest points are its characters, and they truly do continue to leave lasting impressions right until the end. That said, I liked how dumb the final arc was, and I mean that in the best way possible. Jagaaan had an incredible start, a rough middle, and a decent ending that's probably a little too happy for me.\n\nOverall, it's... fine, it just didn't live up to what it could have been like early on. If you want to turn off your brain for a little and watch people with cool bioweapons shoot each other's heads off while flying in the sky, this is a good way to pass the time.",

      review:
        "Demon Slayer, undoubtedly, is a manga that packs a powerful punch. From its action-packed battles to the beautifully rendered artwork, there is much to admire about this series. The fights in the Demon Slayer manga are nothing short of exceptional, setting a new standard for action sequences in the shonen genre. The simple yet masterful storytelling and dynamic artwork come together to create a series of battles that are gripping, intense, and emotionally charged. As a reader, one is completely engrossed in each fight, feeling like a part of the action itself. The illustrations are not only visually stunning but also incredibly fluid, capturing the movements andexpressions of the characters with remarkable detail. This level of attention to detail makes every fight feel alive and immersive, drawing readers into the heart of the action. \n\nThe characters in Demon Slayer are at the heart of the manga, each contributing unique qualities that make them captivating and relatable. Tanjiro's unwavering determination to save his sister, Zenitsu's growth from cowardice to courage, and Inosuke's wild nature in him.\n\nNow, let's talk about the Hashiras; they have their own struggles, vulnerabilities, and complexities that make them all the more relatable and human. Learning about their backgrounds and motivations adds an extra layer of depth to the manga's narrative.. Together, the characters create a gripping and emotionally resonant narrative that keeps the manga thoroughly engaging from start to finish.\n\nFor the Upper Moons, they have intricately woven backstories and motivations that are unveiled with masterful precision throughout the story. As we delve into their enigmatic pasts, we develop a profound understanding of the demons' struggles, desires, and vulnerabilities, blurring the lines between good and evil.\n\nI also want to talk about the arcs, specifically the final arcs of the story.\n\nWhile the earlier arcs are good, it isn't as good as the final arcs of the story.\nThroughout the final arcs, we witness the Demon Slayers facing their most formidable challenges yet. The battles are not only grand and epic but also deeply personal, as they reflect the characters' growth, resolve, and determination. It's a true testament to the story's ability to connect readers emotionally to the characters, making every victory and loss feel impactful and significant.\n\nMoreover, the final arcs bring the underlying themes of the manga to the forefront, reinforcing the importance of compassion, resilience, and the strength of human bonds. The way the story explores the complexities of good and evil and the shades of gray that exist in between adds depth and nuance to the narrative, elevating it beyond the typical battle-focused shonen series.\n\nThe world-building in these arcs is also commendable, as we get a deeper understanding of the Demon Slayer Corps, the demon hierarchy, and the origin of the demons themselves. The lore surrounding the demon world is expanded, providing a satisfying explanation to many lingering questions while leaving some aspects open to interpretation, adding an air of mystery to the story's conclusion.\n\nFurthermore, the character development in the final arcs is exceptional. The protagonists, particularly Tanjiro, Zenitsu, and Inosuke, undergo profound growth and transformation as they confront their deepest fears and insecurities. It's immensely gratifying to see how far they have come from their initial selves, making their journeys all the more fulfilling.\n\nAs for the upper moons, the final arcs humanize some of the demons, providing insights into their pasts and motivations. This added dimension to the villains adds depth to the conflict, blurring the lines between right and wrong and making the resolution of the story all the more emotionally charged.\n\n\nNow for the flaws:\n\nThe story's initial plot, revolving around the theme of revenge, falls into familiar shonen tropes. While it does eventually evolve, it takes time to move beyond its predictable setup. The pacing can also be uneven at times, oscillating between slow-moving moments and hurried plot developments. More balanced pacing could enhance the overall storytelling. \n\nFLASHBACKS:\nWhile flashbacks are an essential narrative tool to provide backstory and context, I felt that the story occasionally relied too heavily on flashback sequences. This might have caused minor disruptions in the flow of the story for some.\n\nI also want to talk about Muzan Jackson, the primary antagonist of Demon Slayer. \nWhile his initial introduction set the stage for a formidable and menacing villain, his overall character development felt lacking and one-dimensional.\n\nThroughout the manga, Muzan's characterization primarily revolved around a desire for immortality and survival. This singular focus limited the depth of his character, leaving him feeling more like a generic evil figure rather than a fully fleshed-out antagonist with intricate layers of emotion and background.\n\n\nOverall, Demon Slayer is an exceptional manga that stands out with its simple yet compelling storytelling, stunning artwork, and well-crafted characters.\n\n8/10",

        "Absolute trash isekai. About as generic and shallow as you can get. MC who is the most powerful existence in the universe is forced back to school... This is probably the 100th manga I've read with this exact same setup. There is practically no story here. The manga is so generic it could be copy and pasted from anything. Within the span of a single volume the MC has a harem, taken over the school, and killed the most powerful demon. Every single line of dialogue is predictable. Character development is nonexistent. Again, how or why would anyone care about these characters when they are literalsuper gods? The school drama parts are silly but contain no comedy. In the entire manga I don't think there is a single chapter worth reading.",

      review:
        "tl;dr: A manga with a good cast and solid romance, but that drags on too long and feels intentionally frustrating. Nisekoi is a rom-com centered around how the protagonist, Raku, and a girl named Chitoge are forced to date each other despite hating each in order to help calm the conflict between their two families. In a way I guess this is kind of like Romeo and Juliet, in that it features a couple whose respective families hate each other. But I think of it more like a reverse Romeo and Juliet, because instead of the couple wanting to date and the families being against it,the couple doesn’t want to date and the family’s leaders are for it. Instead of trying to hide the fact that they’re in love and meet secretly, they have to hide the fact that they aren’t but having to put on a show of being in love openly.\n\nHowever, in addition to that there’s a plot thread surrounding what happened in Raku’s past. He made a promise with a girl that he was in love with as a kid that when they grew up they would get married, and as proof of that promise Raku got a lock pendant and the girl was given a key. However, he doesn’t remember who that girl was at all and thus is essentially just looking for a girl with the key to his pendent. The thing is that there are multiple girls with keys that remember a promise like that, none of them seem to actually remember who they made the promise with, and furthermore the lock Raku has seems to be broken so they can’t simply use the keys to check.\n\nTo be frank, the plot in the manga was pretty weak. A seemingly core element of the manga is that Raku’s family is yakuza and Chitoge’s family is American mafia which is why the two are in conflict, but that very rarely matters. Early on there’s this thing about how it’s hard for the two to make friends due to their families, but that gets pushed past really quickly. Nothing yakuza or mafia related ever happens. There are supposed assassins but they never assassinate anyone. Eventually a girl connected to the police force and a girl connected to a Chinese triad come in as well. But still, nothing serious happens. Beyond the fact that everyone is super rich, it’s all just aesthetic. It’s actually kind of bizarre how it never plays into anything at all and no one seems to care. Still, I’m fine with manga that aren’t plot focused and rom-coms especially are generally better that way, so while it is disappointing that something that had potential wasn’t used, I don’t see it as a negative.\n\nWhat was a bigger issue is the other core element, the plot line involving the key and lock. While not having a plot I don’t think is a negative, having a bad plot I think certainly is. And while I don’t think the plot is bad necessarily, the way it was told most certainly is. The problem is that is moves incredibly slowly while still constantly being at the forefront. It’s constantly throwing in details that feel like they’re pushing forward in solving the mystery but there’s rarely ever actually any progress. Rather, after it seems like new information is learned, it’ll pretty much always introduce further new information that results in the information previously learned not actually mattering and things being just as mysterious as they were before. It’s frustrating and annoying and wholly unnecessary.\n\nStill, even with the weak plot, the majority of the manga is just the cast living their lives while attending high school so the cast is able to hold up the manga pretty well. Raku is dense and indecisive, but the manga manages to write him pretty well as a good person that genuinely cares about everyone around him so as far as dense and indecisive protagonists go, he’s a pretty great one. None of the heroines are all that deep, but they all have pretty solid personalities and are all written to be pretty likable, so it’s pretty likely that most readers will end up fond of at least one of them.\n\nThe problem is that though there are definite highs and lows, overall things just get too repetitive. While the cast is all pretty likable, no one has a character arc. There are maybe hints of character development here and there, but not enough to matter much in the grand scheme of things. Furthermore, while the cast are likable, they have a very rigid role in the story and they never really step out of it. They’re always in similar situations which they respond to in similar ways without anything too wild ever happening. It becomes immensely predictable and to a degree dull. A lot of the comedy is also rooted in this, and thus while the comedy is decent enough per se, it too starts feeling repetitive and dull. This may not have been a problem when reading it weekly as it came out, but when binge reading it in around a week, I started to feel burnt out on the whole thing.\n\nStill, the romantic aspect I think was handled decently enough that in the grand scheme of things, the manga came out okay. Half of the heroines don’t have a relationship arc, they’re just in love with Raku from before the manga started and remain in love with him. The other half have relationship arcs, but only one felt like it actually fleshed things out properly and was well written. Still, the manga does manage to write all of them being in love and all that fluffy stuff pretty well so everyone’s story is pretty amusing. The one exception that was especially well written was Chitoge’s relationship arc. While her character doesn’t change much over the course of the series, her development of bonds with the other heroines as well as her bond with Raku is really well written and she’s at the center of a lot of very impactful moments.\n\nThe final stretch to the manga also culminates with a heroine getting picked so I’m sure some will be disappointed that their favorite wasn’t. But although it’s somewhat uncertain for most of the manga, during the final stretch it builds up to the conclusion over time in such a way that it felt really obvious long before it got there and regardless of outcome and was also fair to all of the heroines and hits strong emotional beats with all of them. Thus, I feel it was handled as well it possibly could be and I found it a satisfying conclusion.\n\nThe art I felt was too dull. The quality was decent enough and it could be kind of fun with facial expressions. But just in general even for a manga centered around high school, it just felt too plain and like it was never doing anything interesting or trying to look especially nice. In hindsight I feel that may have been a core part of what led to the manga feeling so repetitive.",

        "This story was just boring. Neither the characters, nor the art, or even the plot made it any better. It was so bland that I didn't even bother remembering the names of the characters. I can see how the people would be traumatized and be affected by the troubling times they faced. Still, I just couldn't get into it. And I'm not so sure, but it seemed like it was one of those romantic relationships where one of the partners was abusive and spoiled - which I don't care for at all (no matter what their background may be). There was also no love, Imean there was, but I just couldn't feel it. It was almost like it was there...just to be there. And a world populated mostly by women, not not just have a man be the main character, and show that not all men are evil - there are still plenty of good men. But...whatever. I don't know if other people will like it, but I suppose they should at least give it a chance. Though I personally wouldn't recommend it.",

      review:
        "Well this was just disappointing. The whole premise of this manga is that mutant monsters appear on this island and try to devour everything within their sights. We see that humanity fights back, as they call in the military to try and fight these abhorrent mutants. Not much to say about this one honestly. Plot is generic and has been done before a million times. Art quality was fine but the monsters were quite disgusting to look at which made it unpleasant to read. From my perspective it just seemed like a more bland and worse version of parasyte: the maxim. If you're looked fora standard, apocalypse manga where humanity is on the brink of death and they have to fight against these seemingly unstoppable monsters, with some decent artwork here and there, I guess you can read this but if not then you can easily skip this and you'll lose out on nothing. Anyways, I recommend watching or reading parasyte over this because its a very similar concept but executed so much better. If you've seen it already, you'll know what I'm talking about. And if not, then get on it.\n\nOverall: 5/10",

        "Masterpiece. Must-watch for all romance-comedy fans- it's a classic! People who've seen the anime might think: Oh, this was perfect, I'm sure there's no need to read the manga too. People who think this are mistaken. The anime is good but there are so many little things the anime forgets or makes different! We get to see much more about Tamaki in manga, because the anime never fully adapted the manga (I'm still waiting for season 2 ( T w T)/ ). It's an easy and quick read, with a beautiful story. Please read this manga if you haven't! P.S. My favorite quote: Because I'm a genius, I wasn'ttraumatized!",

        "Meguru Ueno is not a stranger in this site, being the writer of Hajimete no Gal, a famous work of fiction about gyarus in a relationship and Gal-sen, about the same topic. This is what happens when he crosses the line and writes doujinshi. If you're here for boobs or for dark skinned girls, you're in for a treat. There's really no real story here, not even time to build one, but you can see the gyaru teasing personality that is characteristic in Ueno's works, but with a twist: since it's a doujin, they actually do go all the way. The girls are cute, the sexis unique for his works, you get exactly what you're searching for. As as fan of Ueno's dumpster fires i loved it, and so will you.",

        "I'm slightly surprised at the relatively low rating this manga has. I approached it with hesitation, fully expecting to drop it in a few chapters, just to continue reading pleasantly surprised. Sure, it has its shortcomings (to be discussed below), but it still is a solid 7-7.5/10 series. So, onto the main selling points of why it's good: 1) ART Marvelous. The shading, the thicker lines of the artstyle, the very expressive foreground (characters, their facial expressions etc.) vs the slightly toned-down backgrounds...The artstyle here is very specific and I haven't seen many other series emulate this kind of mood/feeling. The contrast between the deadpan/stone-faced teacher and the overly expressivestudents is also very well-done.\n\n2) PLOT\n\nWere it just your usual semi-coherent smut featuring some taboo (read: immoral/unethical) relationships, I'd have dropped this in two chapters in at most.\n\nLuckily, the author shifts the tone and focuses on heavier emotional impact, character background (to flesh out everybody's personalities better) and darker undertones. \n\nWhile that's a plus for me, I can see why others who came here for comedy/ecchi would be disappointed. Ultimately this will be the dividing line between liking the series or just putting a 'meh' stamp on it.\n\nWHAT COULD BE BETTER\n\nThat said, I didn't like how it all wrapped up. You'll find out for yourself, and I can see why many people would be stoked for how the series reaches the finish line...But for me it was a bit too convenient of a copout. From various angles - both storyline-related, and ambiguous from a purely moral viewpoint.\n\nAdditionally, some of the chapters were too short/filler-y, which is a big no-no for a series that short. Luckily, they don't detract too much of the pacing/overall mood - but I still wish they were longer/more packed with something of value.\n\nAll in all, though, this was a series that exceeded my expectations. Considering you have only 30 chapters to go through, I highly recommend you blaze through 'Joshikousei to Seishokusha-san' in 2-3 hours of reading. A commendable debut from the mangaka, for sure.",

        "Gay man here... this manga is a contemporary masterpiece, I'm just gonna say that. This whole manga feels like is full of guilt and self constrain... because it feels like that! Is about a gay man who is \"forced\" to have a girlfriend, just by that the idea even for me is awful for real but that's the point, this manga is about morals. Everyone has different ways to cope about their own problems and some of them aren't healthy at all and this work, really knows how to work on that (even I struggle irl to get out of the closet). The ethics on thismanga are just down bad, the way on how they solve their own problems don't really make them \"be\" good people but... who really makes the things in the right way? Usually we just by fear try to protect ourselves from our surroundings and create fields to don't get hurt (just like evangelion, lol) so... I don't think no one can judge the way to cope, really.\n\nThe way on how the narrative is telled is amazing, the characters and the struggles of them feel real (of course, more idealized). The only downside I see is that the leitmotiff of Queen kinda feels forced at times but I'm not gonna lie, when it hits well, hits like a bullet. Even the \"bad\" characters althought they are bad, they are humans and you can feel that all throughout the story. The most important part is the fact that KNOWS when to break up the drama and throw you a joke because... if there wasn't any just to break tension I would be lying on the floor of my room while crying. The art is... great, isn't a masterpiece of drawing like idk Vagabond or name your random manga that is amazingly drawed but is a good relax from the common shoujo/josei that you see everyday, which is nice IMHO.\n\nAny way, I'm writing to much text but you can see what are the lights and shadows of the work and... maybe is because I'm a soft gaycel who struggles with their sexuality why I'm such a bitch with this. I find the main character an asshole but at the same time just an idiot as I (and I know if you read it, this ain't healty) but that's the charm of that jerk. Just stop reading this and go to read the manga, is amazing and made me cry, with that is enough to know that this shit hits hard.",

        "I am a big fan of Higashimura-sensei. Her funny jokes and beautiful pictures make this manga one of my favorites. But, it might be a bit hard for fans from other countries. You need to understand some Japanese to get all the jokes. The title, 'Tarareba', is a good example. It is a mix of two words, 'Tara' and 'Reba'. Both words mean 'if' in English, but also stand for 'Pacific cod' and 'Liver' in Japanese. The characters and the story come from this mix of words. But don't worry if you don't know much Japanese. The story is really good. It's about people who wish theycould change something or want to start something new. I really like the character Key (Kagitani). His words always touch my heart and make me want to do my best.\n\nEven though there are only 31 episodes, every single one is great. You will find:\n\n・Interesting characters\n・A story you can connect with\n・Lines that make you think\n\nIf you're interested in Japanese, or if you ever wanted to change something in your life, I highly recommend this manga. It's more than just a book, it's a journey of emotions and dreams.",

        "As a 20-something reader, this was one of the manhwas that was the hardest for me to finish. Maybe it is me being used to the main character being cool-headed, but I was only able to feel ok about the FL only after the main story finished. On the other hand, I had no problems with the epilogue. The villain got up to so much unnecessary things, for no good reason except for how she has always stolen the FL's love interests lol. The characters felt very basic, from how I read it, it didn't feel like they had any character development. The only thingthat I can give a thumbs up for is the art. And that's pretty much it.",

        "Yandare warning & dub con (Uke consents but then keeps saying stop, slow down and stop so dub con incase anyone doesn't want to read a story with that) Their second time the uke fully consents and even begs for it, those warnings aside the story is good for a Yandare story, unlike most Yandare stories this one has the Seme give the uke space so the uke can realize he loves the Seme which is very different from most Yandare stories where the Yandare just force themselves regardless of everything. Over all the story revolves around the uke figuring out his feelings towards the seme(the Yandare character) after the Yandare character confesses. Then we see the Yandare and how he has worked to make the uke fall for him. It's hard to say who the MC and ML is because it starts off with the Uke's point of view but then other chapters it's the Semes point of view so they are both the ML &amp; the MC, that is why I just refered to them as Uke &amp; Seme because otherwise it could confuse people. The Smut scenes were hot especially their 2nd time (with the exception of their first time since it was dubcon - that one as well as the ending is what made me rate this a 8 instead of 10)\n\nThis isn't for those who want something cute and fluffy but definitely a really good Yandare story for those who do like the genre. The ending though was abrupt, it felt like it was going to get a second volume however from what I know it doesn't have one. Really hope the author continues this story because it's definitely good with nice art!",

        "The story is like all gyaru stories that are similar, but with the twist that’s it’s from the readers pov. It has the cliches but they are well thought out and so are the main characters you can feel the personality with each female lead. Otaku-kun(you) has no feeling or emotion in his speech, which makes a bit of sense since it’s supposed to be us. But it kinda ruined the pov aspect of it since it felt like I was a robot. It’s extra short so we don’t get to see much of the characters backgrounds but it seemed like there was going tobe alot more chapters some the ending felt a bit rushed. It didn’t completely tie the loose ends which I’m surprised that this manga even had. It’s in full color so it’s extremely easy to see everything, but I’m every chapter the main focus is on one of the four “female leads”. The percentage bar at the end of each chapter was a nice touch and I enjoyed seeing the percentages, it felt similar to a vn which was a nice touch. In the end it was a good time waster which only took me an hour to complete all the chapters.",

        "I wouldn't call it especially ‘bad’… but because I can't call it bad it cant have the status of ‘so bad it's good’. Art (6) Unique but not too unique as to where you might accidentally consider the story good. The lines were clean and the panel spacing was deliberate enough. Characters (???) I can say without a shadow of a doubt that absolutely none of the characters make sense… This is, of course, bad; but so so entertaining. Random plot points are pulled out of the ass of nearly every single character, which they BARELY manage to make work and is so obviously shoehorned in to make theending fluffier. If any of the characters thought for half a millisecond then the story would have ended on the first chapter. Which again is obviously bad but I cant help to find it hilarious. \n\nThere were only three characters I particularly enjoyed, one of them was the comically evil dad and the other showed up in maybe 2 short scenes, thats not exactly a great look for a character-focused story.\n\nStory (4)\n\nIf you're looking for something relaxing to read look elsewhere, it nearly felt like there was a plot point in every single chapter. That speed can have its advantages but in here about halfway through it feels more like the adrenaline wore off and you were just waiting for the end. Even with the pacing the writing must have been the biggest contributor towards ruin, instead of showing romance it's more like they held up a sign saying ‘romance’ and we’re just supposed to go along with it… that could have been excused if this wasnt literally a romance manga. \n\nAll in all, this is the kind of manga you can forget within 30 minutes of reading it, which is for the best since remembering it will just give you a headache.",

        "To me this was just boring. I didn't like or care for anything or anyone. The characters, be it Vincent, George or Danto, were just bland. The art was just find, but it still wasn't anything to brag about. I also felt that it lacked a proper story. I just couldn't find it funny. I know that it tried, but it just didn't work. And while it tried to give a love triangle...I also think it failed in that category. I don't really know what else to say, other than I just didn't think this was funny or romantic. I will say that while theywere men...they did look good in those tight dresses. \n\nI don't know if other people will like it, but I suppose they should at least give it a chance. Though I personally wouldn't recommend it.",

        "if anyone has 5 minutes (or less) to spare, i'd recommend reading this. for something so short, it manages to leave you uplifted about life and the small things it brings in our everyday. kurita's style of drawing is extremely pleasing to look at and the way the sweet and simple story is told through imagery makes it all more compelling. it's a slice of life so don't expect much action or adventure, just a girl learning about how much brighter life can be. within the short amount of space, i would say the characters were developed enough to feel intriguing and real; responding toeach other and developing a friendship like one would experience in real life. all in all, a very pleasant read especially for a oneshot :)",

        "A rather short oneshot that I can only assume sets the stage for the full release manga by the same author. The sci-fi setting is rather intriguing, due to the page limitation we don't get too much information but more than enough to make us interested in more details. You can tell that the author has thought about the world and the characters in it. We are already introduced to multiple storylines of the characters, motivations and worldbuilding. A oneshot that definitely sets the tone for fur further things to come and makes you interested in more. The art is not very standard and pleasant to look at.Very soft strokes with beautiful details on backgrounds, architecture and machinery.\n\nOverall I can recommend this oneshot for a quick read with nice worldbuilding and refreshing art.",

        "Easily a plot that could have been written by Lars Von Trier. Comparable to Nymphomaniac, Antichrist, and The House That Jack Built. It is a series that knew how to work with surprising mastery both human filthiness (on the part of the professor) and the issue of acquired psychopathy (on the part of the girl). It's far from being a hentai manga. It's like he called himself a hentai just to get more attention or get around some weird legislation, like what they did with A-Kite. Anyone who starts reading it simply forgets the erotic content of the thing and ends up being trapped bythe story itself. It has the impact and depth that Mirai Nikki tried and failed.",

        "Yumi to kurumi is a bittersweet slice of life tale that illustrates one's personal growth and happiness in a shott span of 8 chapters.    Enter the life of Yumi Tanaka; a socially inept office lady who thinks lowly of herself. After stumbling upon a sentient doll that deems to bring happiness to its owners, Yumi's life began to change for the better.   For a relatively short read we got to see Yumi's healthy development of becoming a better person, that doesn't feel forced or shallow in a way that got me intrigued as to how it will goes down. The story itself is cute and simple, andeasy enough to follow, as it is short, however the shortness of the story is also its shortcoming: It is very shortlived that I wished there were more chapters to further explore more of the story. \n    As for the art, the artworks and paneling are smoothly drawn and articulate to follow, it synergizes well with the cute and innocent artstyle. \n\n Overall, I'd rate this manga a 6/10, I honestly can't rate it any higher. It has good potential and  I wish there was more to it. Yet I would still recommend it when you got 20-30 minutes or to spare.",

        "I only picked up the manga because I loved the first season of the anime but I was extremely disappointed with the second one, so I had some expectations. That means the first part of the story, the initial escape, I already knew and love. Great story, concept and pacing. The second part was practically all new to me and it was good fun. A lot of new characters that helped make this world feel alive, and a great adventure that never felt too grand for our main cast. I loved how all the characters were important, not necessarily to the plot but to Emma(our main POV), with such intensity that you really cared for them all. The worldbuilding was really good too, giving this story very solid surroundings that never felt like they had any conceptual holes.\n\nIn the end, it didn't open my third eye but I did tear up a time or two and the work is definitely of quality. Not a favourite, but a very solid recommendation that I'm sure a wide public can enjoy.",

        "This story is honestly just pretty good from beginning to end. It was a pretty interesting twist to the whole monster invasion dungeon gate genre. Where our main character instead of using something like a system or an op ability gets a pretty interesting ability which at first won't seem like it would be pretty powerful but by coincidence and fate the ability became really useful. The original premise is actually pretty interesting and exciting but the plot was carried out fairly blandly and the characters are also very bland where they basically only have 1 characteristic and are never developed further. I literally don'tremember any part of the manhwa where I felt truly hype and truly felt with the characters of the story. The ending especially is not good it was rushed and so many stupid things happened that made it lose all stakes. It is long so I actually won't recommend if you are looking for something to read, but if you are looking for specifically a gate dungeon type manhwa this one ain't bad.",

        "I appreciate this more than I enjoyed this. It is trying to be something, something a little different to your typical 2 character manga. I'm not entirely sure it quite accomplishes it at a level where I could call it a good story. Some stories can have quite unrealistic relationships, in terms of closeness, love at first sight, drop everything to be with this person you just met, unroot your life completely because of this dude, that can be quite overwhelming. This does the opposite, but veers too far in its own direction goes back to feeling too strange and frustrating. They want to be close,they want to be together but they respect each other's boundaries; they respect them too much, and their relationship ends up feeling limp and unfinished. Its progression chapter-to-chapter felt unfocused and pointless. Overall it feels unfinished. Overall it needed more drama, more conflict, to challenge the characters, and it felt like the author didn't know how to add that here because they made the relationship so very delicate that if it was poked too hard it would simply evaporate, but if that really is the case, is that something worth caring about?\n\nThe art is amazing, though. Just by the art alone, I think this is worth reading.",

        'This is my honest opinion, I am NOT being a contrarian just because this is one of the most famous manga. - Cons Bleach is mostly Boring. The manga is made up of 95% fighting, 5% training and SOL moments. This might be good for some people who prefer nothing but action, but this is such a major flaw. Because not only is the amount of fighting so skewed, the fights themselves are extremely boring and predictable. A large majority of the fights can be taken out of the manga and ZERO plot would be lost. Not only that, the fights follow an unbearable structure of"Bad guy powers up, Good guy powers up too, Bad guy powers up again, Good guy powers up again, Bad Guy powers up with their hidden power/move, but it turns out all along the Good guy could also power up with a secret move and oh look the Good guy was overpowered to begin with". That fake tension and constant, unending "But what will you do against *THIS* move" that they keep pulling out of the hat every time you think the fight will end is nauseating and completely pulls you out of the experience by DRAGGING on for so, SO long. All these elements are doubly offensive when the manga speedruns everything that isn\'t fighting. Ichigo will train for 3 days, or 10, or 15 minutes in a different dimension where time is slowed and BARELY anything is shown, he just shows up with new power and we see next to nothing of his struggles unlike something like Dragon Ball. The manga isn\'t comfortable outside of fights. Most of the arcs are overly long due to all these compounding issues, and have nothing of substance. This manga put me to sleep multiple times, and I still binged it in less than 10 days. The ending was also infamously awful, but that was due to Bleach being cancelled abruptly as well as Kubo\'s health issues in the last arc, but it still leaves a sour taste in your mouth. \n\n- Pros\nThe only good thing this manga does exceptionally well is its characters, which is odd because they barely get any time to develop because of all the fighting. But Kubo has crafted every character to be unique and memorable, and all have their own ambitions and good and bad points. You will forget the fights, not the characters. Some mystery elements and the world in general are intriguing, but not nearly as much as Naruto or One Piece. Character designs are cool and have hidden meanings, the music that Kubo assigns to specific characters are fitting and add that extra layer of depth. Despite the fights being boring, there are genuinely some great fights, but few and far between. Some of the comedy is funny. The Art is good too, sometimes great! \n\n- Overall thoughts\n\nThis is the last of the BIG 3 I read, and It baffles me that this manga/anime is held up to Naruto and One Piece as equals. \n\nIf you enjoy endless, mindless fights with no substance, give it a shot. Otherwise, stay away from this Boring slog.',

      review:
        'o que dizer sobre esta BOMBA? Simplesmente horrível, o manga se baseia no sofrimento do protagonista onde ele é abusado de forma física, psicológica e sexual. É uma tortura para os leitores. Se você está aqui por algum colega seu te fazer desafios como "duvido conseguir ler este manga ate o final", acredite, não vale a pena. Não agrega em nada, nem sequer é interessante. É apenas uma historia sobre pessoas conturbadas que sofrem a cada capítulo, não de forma construtiva ou interessante, apenas cruel e desumano. Não leva a lugar nenhum, é ruim do inicio ao fim. A arte é agradável, um traço jogadono lixo ao ser utilizado nessa obra. Personagens principais tem suas historias perturbadoras reveladas durante a história onde, para variar, é baseado em manipulação psicologia, abuso familiar, aliciação e etc. Puramente desagradável, deprimente.',

        "if you want a mystery with lots of twists, you're going to read the right manga. I was very moved by the ending and how it all developed. The story is very well done and has no loose ends. the art is simply magnificent! I got emotional with the ending and enjoyed every moment, there wasn't a bad part! The protagonist is wonderful and VERY realistic, you really feel in his shoes. The antagonists are awesome too, if I can call them \"antagonists\". I think it's hard for a suspense to hold so much. Several moments I had my jaw dropped and I read everything very quicklyfor that too.",

        "I used to think classic works were not so generic, perhaps my perception was wrong. As I came across Pluto’s ending it sure felt generic. Anyway, to start, the first 2 volumes were really great, I was so invested in it but after that somewhere along the way I couldn’t find the same enjoyment & wanted to finish it as soon as possible. The anti robot religious group had potential but wasted it very hilariously. And what happened to Adolf and his family afterwards? They just left him alone or what? Why did Gesicht have so much hatred? Why was his memory erased? So manyquestions left untold.\n\nBeing the greatest of Robots except Gesicht and Atom all the others were lackluster! What was the point of being called the advanced destruction weapons when you can’t even behave like a robot, like they were literally more human than humans themselves. Don’t even talk about feats, except Gesicht  and Atom all the other robots were feat less fodder man how can they be called the greatest of robots when they acted kinda pathetic or should I a even a human could have done better for the story with a Iron man suit than those robots.\n\nGesicht was charismatic and as a character entertaining but the moment he died This manga lost its charm and I lost my will. Gesicht  could have finished the story,It was his duty, responsibility but no the author had to revive Atom.\nAntagonist of this Manga was also a disappointment. I don't know how the robots lost to that piece of crap! “God of war” what a pathetic joke!\n\nThe art was good and in some panels great, no complaints in that part, It was detailed enough for my taste.\n \nI don’t really think this work should be considered a masterpiece as it seems a lot of people think that way. But there were some good parts too. Certainly this is not a bad manga or perhaps I expected a little more.",

        'Definitely a cute read, the first chapter is a bit of "oh so we got that heartless slut seme then" but that thought was incorrect, the seme is loving and caring for the uke, he is careful with him during their first time and there is consent! There is no unnecessary drama or drama for that matter, thankfully no cheating/NTR and NO SA SCENES. The story revolves around them both and even continues a bit after they get together which was nice to see, we get to see a nice time skip as well which is cute. The name the ML gives the MCis also cute and also chapter 2 (maybe it was chapter 1 at the end of it) was hilarious so it has some comedy as well. \nThankfully no annoying characters or anything and even the one person who finds out about their relationship is understanding which we like to see! Definitely a cute read!',

      review:
        "Our Party Is Wrong, or Oretachi no Party wa Machigatteiru, is the title of this ostensibly fantasy and comedy manga, but should really be called in my opinion as, Our Party Is Messed Up. The story has a party of four adventurers, a quartet of tabletop fantasy role playing game analogues with job titles for names, were about to subjugate the demon lord of their world. In an act of spite and survival, casting the spells sealed the demon lord for a year as a tactical retreat, the four adventurers got a different curse each. That’s where the fun begins. This was a short series,30 chapters collected in 3 volumes. No obvious indication it had an abbreviated run, given an ending that was satisfying, of sorts, and true to the irreverent spirit of the story. This story was built to run for a long time, given that the characters had job titles for names, and characterization based on cliches, and tropes found in other fantasy stories. \n\nAs I said, the fun begins when the curses kicked in disrupted the relationship dynamics between the party members for comedy as only gender bending, and de-aging can do. Imagine an ardent womanizer knight whose preference turned opposite and chasing men as he did skirts. A tsundere mage prince turned female and still a tsundere. A warrior at his prime physical peak turned into an early pubescent version of himself without the muscles sounds to be the only “normal” curse, but he must deal with the unwanted sexual advances of the pervert knight and his growing attraction to female version of the tsundere prince. They all need to deal with these changes while looking for the final missing member of their party. \n\nIn the second volume, the main cast deal with another party of ninjas, led by the man named Ninja, keeping to the theme of having job titles for names. They have a vendetta against the pervert knight that was seeded in one of the early chapters, and their encounters with the cursed crew proved to be interesting and entertaining. \n\nIn the third volume, the author wraps it all, introducing one new key supporting character, while keeping the rest to be background characters, and culminating in one final fateful encounter with the missing cursed party member.  \n\nThe plotting is tight, with all important story threads converging and resolving in the third volume. Hence, my impression that this is as intended all along. \n\nI recommend this to anyone looking for a fantasy or comedy manga series with low commitment to read while waiting for the next chapter for their main favorite series. It is entertaining, and I’m surprised there is no official English version of it yet.",

        "It is safe to say that this manga definitely is not for everyone. If you are a fan of militaria and real-robot mecha, you should give this manga a try, but if not, go read something else. It should be noted that even though this takes place in the Front Mission universe (during the events of the first game to be exact), you do not need to be familiar with the Front Mission series to enjoy this manga. I think everything you need to know about the setting is explained very well to newcomers. I think what holds this story down the most is the author'sreliance on shock value. He wants to show you how horrible war can be: youre seeing civilians getting mowed down, women being raped, torture, and other warcrimes. But after so many tragedies youre just like \"oh come on\". And its grating how the USN in this story acts nothing like how they did in the games. In the games, neither side was completely good or evil. It wanted to show you that both factions had good people and bad people within their ranks, and how war was rarely just good vs evil. In DL&amp;DS, the USN faction seems to be completely filled with subhuman ogre men who think of nothing but murder and rape, where Nanking is just another Tuesday.\n\nAnother thing to be aware of is it seems the author was very horny when writing this. Almost every arc has a sex scene in it, or at the very least a character doing something weird and pervy. Now, some people like their stories to be full of sex. But if you are like me, seeing two characters who don't even love eachother have passionless sex will keep you rolling your eyes over many pages.\n\nNow lets talk about the good things in this manga.\n\nAs stated in the previous paragraph, this manga is separated into arcs; each arc being its own self-contained story that gives you different perspectives on the Huffman conflict. So its not just about the mech pilots, but also the grunts, the civilians, the media, and others. The quality of each arc wavers between being great and kinda sucking, but none of them are so bad that it would warrant skipping. Besides, there are a few reoccurring characters throughout the manga, so it is worth seeing how all these connected stories culminate, especially for one specific character.\n\nBut If there is one thing that is consistent, it is the art. The mechanical designs of the Wanzers and other military vehicles and gear look great, and the battles are epic. Its the type of manga that has certain pages where youll catch yourself looking at them for minutes, admiring all the detail put into it. The character designs are good too. You can totally check out this manga for the art alone if thats the type of person you are.",

        "One of the best mangas I've ever read. The only reason this manga did not land on a 10/10 is because of a few key points that I believe the author could have avoided. The base story is boy meets girl, boy and girl get together for a band and romance follows. But the author makes this typical romance saga into a drama full of tragedy and hope, the likes of which is rarely seen in this medium. Let's begin with the breakdown. What makes this manga good is the storytelling, the drama, the tragedies and the feelings of hope. It's a story that brings tearsof sadness and tears of joy and a mix in between. To break down what makes this storytelling so good is to describe it as follows: It's real. The story in a lot of ways feels real and that's important to understand for how excellent it is. The characters' relationships, their emotions, their reactions. Some feel exaggerated, of course, this is a manga after all, but a lot of it is real. It's not just the storytelling either, but the art depicting each emotion in a perfect way. \n\nBut what makes this weaker is the comedy and lewd aspects of it. In this tragic drama that's also filled with so much hope and promise, the comedy attempts fall flat. There's not a single unique joke in this entire story and considering the surrounding story it doesn't feel natural. The lewd art could have been avoided as well without removing from the story. It doesn't add and it feels pointless. The ending doesn't feel rushed, it's perfect but there are two relations that occur in the ending that also feel unnatural, although that won't be covered further in this review.",

      review:
        "As an artist myself, this was a bit difficult in the beginning. Him suddenly getting blind because of his work, made me quite anxious, not gonna lie. Being blind surely is scary for everyone, but even harder for people, whose work requires them to see. Authors can still easily write after becoming blind, but artists? Drawing without eyes is a bit difficult. Anyways. The beginning was good. I don't really like reading hetero stories, so I didn't go in with many expectations, but actually got surprised for the better. Sori's and Min's relationship was really healthy and I could truly feel their love for each other.They were happy and actually couple goals.\n\nBut then the whole jealousy plot started and it really just got exhausting to read. It started around chapter 10 and stretched throughout chapter 82, with only there being a character development.\nIt wasn't even them. Usually romance stories have love-triangles, that involves the MCs directly, because either one of them can't let their ex go or whatever, right? This was worse, even. The MCs were just pawns here, pushed around by everyone. Trying to hold on to their love for each other, but their disabilities getting in the way and making it easier for the antagonists to intervene. It really was just the antagonists working together to get what they want, without the MCs even knowing what's going on. Just pushed around like babies, naive and unable to do anything.\nBut not quite. Sori was just that throughout the whole story, but Min kept becoming more of a jerk too. He lied so much to her. It was so unfair. She kept working hard to earn money, even going for a modeling career because it would give him enough money for an eye surgery; and what does he do? Lie. Lie about his condition, that he's gonna die soon. Kept pretending everything's fine, while she was the one worrying. He lied about his mother at first too, they overcame that step, and he promised to never lie to her again. ... He managed about 2 weeks before lying again. It's just sad. I feel so bad for Sori.\n\nI genuinely don't know how I managed to keep reading. I'm so tired and energy-deprived. I'm not even sad, even though this was supposed to be a drama and emotional. I really didn't care anymore for the characters by the end. I just wanted it to end. And when it finally did, I felt nothing. Empty shell. Just glad it's over.\nOnly sad part being is that I hoped for a good story. There aren't many comics about deaf or blind characters, especially not two disabled MCs. So, of course you'd hope for it to be good, right? Sadly it's not. Unless you're a huge fan of extreme drama and jealous characters, who'd do everything to get what they want, even if it'll hurt the person they \"love\", this might be your next favorite. But unfortunately I'm not a drama-loving person. It's fine to some extent, but this was too much.\n\nIf the book was only from chapter 0 to around 30, I'd probably give it 5 stars. As said, I really liked it at the beginning. I teared up lots of times. Some of the early chapters are quite emotional and reflective.\nSadly only gets downhill and the focus shifts to the jealous side characters, who will do anything to force the people they \"love\" to be with them. Worst part is they didn't even get lectured for it. Sure, they didn't get to be with them in the end, but one of them should actually sit in jail. But does he? No. He's free as ever and even has a family. So disgusting.\n\n~\n\nI've heard a lot of criticism about the art, but I have to disagree on that. It might not be very clean and aesthetically pleasant, and there are much better works which are much older than this, but it works for the story. Even with that much drama, it is still a slice of life story. It's not bad. It might be bad for every other story, and might seem a bit lazy too, but that's life isn't it?\nI've seen lots of people especially criticize the crying. That it's ugly. Well, surprise, crying in real life is ugly too. If you want Disney-crying, go watch a disney movie or read a fantasy story. But this is a slice of life and drama story about hardships. You think you look pretty when you have a breakdown and cry your soul out? Probably not. In my opinion, it would've been worse and taken away the realistic part, if the author gave them princess-faces during the crying panels.\nYes, some of the expressions look ugly, but that's what makes it good.\n\nAnother point I liked, but many disliked for some reason: the comedy. While it was a lot and sometimes a bit unnecessary maybe, it was a part I'm glad the author kept. With all the extreme drama going on, the comedy brought the story down to earth again, reminding you that it's slice of life. And with all the eye-rolls I've done, the funny bits made me smile again. Forgot all the tension for a moment and could enjoy at least one or two panels, before it went annoying again.\n\nI also didn't mind the POVs and backstories from the other characters, and even the pets. It was random, true, but in a good way. You don't normally get this much screen-time for background characters like this, so it was interesting getting to know them more.\nNice world-building and reminds you once more that everyone goes through hardships, all the time, even though they are not the MC. Sounds obvious but, admit it, we do keep forgetting that sometimes.\n\n~\n\nAs with every book, there were good and bad parts. For this, the bad parts weigh down more than the good ones, sadly.\nDo I recommend it? Not really.\nIf you only want to read it because of the blind and deaf representation, go ahead. That part is more or less well-made. And the way they communicate is wholesome.\nBut if you actually want to enjoy the 84 chapters and are hoping for a good story, then don't. Unless, as said, you're a drama-fan, this is rather tiresome to digest. The ending isn't even worth all that and was very predictable anyways. Fairy-tale like.\n\n~\n\nIs there strong character development? Chapter 0-81? No. They only got worse. Chapter 82-83? Yes. Suddenly a 180 degree change.\nDid you find the characters loveable? I liked 2 characters; Sori and Yeom. Dong also a bit, but his crush on that one girl is a huge toxic trait. Otherwise every character is just annoying or an asshole or both.\nWould you say the cast of characters is diverse? Apart from the deaf and blind character (and the grandpa who wears leggings and heels (he's slaying those looks btw)), no. Everyone else is stereotypically k-drama. Very extreme and alike.\nAre the flaws of the main character(s) a main focus of the book? Yes. Their flaws are their main personality. It's not just \"flaws\", it really is incredibly toxic. Most know of their \"flaws\" but don't even bother to change.",

      review:
        "The other reviewer obviously didn't grasp what they were reading, even a little, and their assessment that the piece was empty of meaning or value or merit is incredibly unfair. Even calling it hentai at all simply because it has sexual content at its core proves the reviewer's failure to understand the author's intent or even the genre of the work. To be clear: this is a work of SURREALIST HORROR. The sexual content isn't meant to arouse, it's not \"sick and twisted\" out of some extreme fetish --the effect on the reader of making them feel disturbed and disgusted is fully intentional. Much like thelegendary H.R Giger, who also worked in the surrealist horror genre and made extensive use of sexual imagery, the point is to assault the reader's sense of the natural order and well-being through vulnerable vectors like sexuality and gore in order to induce intense visceral reactions.\n\nThe work is crafted to use shock and revulsion and insane levels of outrageous strangeness to shake the reader's sense of reality and normality and orientation within a world that makes sense. It's not meant to be a pleasant experience, quite the opposite it's meant to assault your mind with disorienting violations of the fundamentals of reality in order to leave you in a profoundly disturbed state akin to vertigo. The more messed up you feel after reading it, the more effectively the author / artist has done his job.\n\nSurrealist horror is certainly not a genre for everyone, especially when it's as extreme as this. This is the very outer fringe of an already niche genre, and so it's only suitable for those who want and are prepared for that kind of content and the intense experience it provides.\n\nIf you are one of those surrealist horror junkies for whom too much is never enough, or just curious about how crazy it can get on the ragged fringe of the darkest corners of the human imagination, then step right up you are in for one hell of a ride. Everyone else, I very much suggest heeding the content disclaimers and look for something a bit milder than the equivalent of ghost pepper salsa.",

      review:
        "Just the basic concept of world building when MC (human) saves an Elf (FMC). The story progresses, and... The characters and their interactions are cute. Disappointed that the FMC & MC didn't even kiss in the entire manga. There's hardly any Nudity and Romance, given that it has these tags. Standard Romance between an Elf and a Human. Innocent elf who doesn't know about the human world, and it's really funny at times. Having read similar stories over the years, this manga doesn't satisfy my desire. Based on my standards, an Elf is one of the sexiest being in fantasy genre, and there's so muchpotential if you wanna make stories on them. Thanks anyway, and hope many of you will enjoy! \n\n5/10.",

        "A revenge fantasy with glimmers of an intriguing narrative, but lack of focus undercuts its potential. Story: 4/10 The betrayed player sent back in time premise shows promise and offers some interesting lore reveals. However, abrupt time skips and pacing issues cause the narrative to feel disjointed at times. The ending cuts off abruptly with no resolution. Art: 7/10 The polished, clean art style serves the story adequately. Action flows smoothly when present. Character designs are somewhat generic but serviceable. Characters: 3/10 The protagonist is an average power fantasy vessel, but his ruthless pursuit of revenge has its appeal. Supporting characters are one-note. Antagonists' motivations remain unclear.Enjoyment: 5/10\nDespite issues with narrative flow and weak characterization, I still found the revenge-driven plot moderately entertaining. The story showed sparks of potential.\n\nIn summary, Kill the Hero is a deeply flawed but sporadically entertaining revenge fantasy. Buried under messy plotting are glimmers of an intriguing narrative. It may appeal to power fantasy fans willing to overlook its issues.",

        "I never would have thought that a story between a father and his daughter will be this so good and emotional. I completed this manga like a month ago and still can feel the heartwarming vibe this manga gave me. First the art style, it is so finely done, I highly appreciate those watercolor arts, it's so calming. The story begins after the main character looses his beloved. His own child, out of nowhere came to see him, Koharu- a sweet and cute girl and Masamune- a fellow nerd i could say. The emotional feeling between them is so well presented. The ending chapters mademe emotional. I would highly recommend this to everyone. Give it a go, you would merrily love it.\n\n.",

        "This manga is the first manga I have read weekly from beginning to the end and although I enjoy it, it isn't that great. I love the main character mashle thoroughly but the side characters definitely leave a lot to be desired. While the main side characters are pretty cool and I do get hyped for them when they battle I don't really care as much as I would with other series. I wouldn't say the plot is bland but it definitely isn't all that great. The plot is pretty straight forward which I like but it doesn't give the chance to really explore theworld. I like that it didn't stretch that long and that it ended at a decent high note. In the end it is a good read but don't expect a revolutionary or insanely intricate story. Just a good read for a fun time.",

      review:
        "Read Ashita no Joe, they said. It's one of those recommendations that say absolutely nothing... And holy shit. Truth be told, this was tougher to read than Berserk. It certainly doesn't feel that way at first, owing to its classical cartoonish style and setup. You couldn't guess how deep this goes on first glance. On second glance. On third glance, because Joe just keeps going. Because unlike Berserk, which requires a good attachment to the cast in addition to its bountiful artwork, Ashita no Joe does not care about your feelings. It only requires you to keep reading, to keep watching Joe in the same wayhe asks Shiraki Yoko to never turn away from true greatness.\n\nThe story kicks off with Joe being a dexterous ruffian. But when he finds himself in juvenile detention, he answers his life's calling to become a boxer. Throughout his journey, he quickly realizes that he is alone in the ring and revels in it. Fight after fight, Joe defies all expectations. The beauty of tomorrow is promising yet ephemeral. Tomorrow will only feature brutal bruises, bloody wounds, and the dust of dust. To everyone else, it is a revolting sight. But to him... That's tomorrow's Joe.\n\nOne thing I found very appalling is the sparse development among its well-written characters. Of course, it's not to say that there's a lack thereof, but it's assumed because the manga overall doesn't need it. Most side characters only grow through the passage of time. Joe goes through intense arcs of emotion and isolation, but quickly grows from it and subtly matures into an apex predator, looking forward to yet another tomorrow. He might continue to thrash around like an unhinged monkey, because one can argue that Joe's fists go through more character development than what Joe displays. But deep down he is one of the most mature sportsman you'll ever witness. All it took was a few moments of tenderness, ones that showcased how attuned he is to reality moreso than anyone else in the room. And he's the one taking all of the punches!\n\nMy god, dude. From his clash with Rikiishi all the way to the final bout, there's this uncanny hook in this manga that keeps you reading. A significant part of it is due to its simplistic structure and pacing, never dragging on and never a bore. Another significant part is the timeless style this manga is drawn in, giving it quite the unique and fresh vibe even today. And what would the manga be without the titular character himself? What would Joe be without the ego, the triple counter, the tenacity of a god to eat all of those punches? One word. Weak.\n\nSo, if you want to set baseline expectations, you should watch Megalobox first. It's a show that's directly inspired by Ashita no Joe, though set in a different universe and much more digestible. Megalobox's characters, premise, and some story beats are vastly similar to Ashita no Joe, though their journeys are wildly different owing to its styles. Megalobox presents boxing as a symphonic spectacle. While Ashita no Joe is basically the same thing, it's much more nuanced than a symphony. It's a deathmatch in hell.\n\nIn conclusion,\n\nIt's very difficult to describe the entirety of Ashita no Joe in a single word, but I think I can.\n\nTomorrow's Joe is UNBELIEVABLE. 10/10.\n\nUntil next time.",

        "I have never read such a bad work from any author that clearly has several mental and personal issues that he needs to work on before committing himself to a manga, as they clearly leak into the story creating a completely apalling experience when reading it, as you can only feel the mental issues of the mangaka hidden behind a layer of irony called plot. You can clearly see that the author is not trying to write a coherent plot, nor trying to develop a set of characters and making a character focused manga (like for example, Vagabond), but he's just trying to dump as many'bizarre' sexually-inspired situations. The manga reads as a outlet for a sexually repressed male.\n\nExpanding on the characters - the manga could have benefited much more from a multi-focused approach, developing more the main character brothers, as well as the recruiter with glasses.\n\nIn short - this work is not to be considered a 'real' manga perse, but just the ramblings of a starting mangaka.",
